# Roadmap

Cadence is still in development. This roadmap documents the plans and ideas for the language,
categorized into immediate/high priority items and lower priority items,
listed in no particular order.

## High Priority

- Performance

  Cadence programs are also currently executed using a tree-walking interpreter,
  which is easy to modify and useful for debugging. However, it is not optimized for performance.
  We are investigating  compilation to improve performance.
  Potential targets / inspirations are WebAssembly, MoveVM, and IELE.

- Standard Library

## Lower Priority

- Host interface

  The current API that allows Cadence to be integrated into a host environment,
  such as the Flow Execution Node, the Flow Emulator, or Flow Playground,
  is not flexible enough and difficult to extend.

  Refactor the pull-based architecture of the current interface to an injection-based architecture.

  Move non-essential type and value declarations out of the core Cadence code.

- [Code formatter / pretty printing of code](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/209)

  Cadence should offer a tool that formats programs.

- [Documentation generator](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/339)

  Cadence should offer a tool that generates human-readable documentation for programs.

- Type aliases

  Cadence should provide a way to define type aliases.

- ABI generation and code generation

  Cadence should offer a tool to generate an ABI file, a description
  of the functionality of a contract.

  An early version of Cadence provided such a tool,
  however it was not used, became unmaintained, and was eventually removed.

  The ABI generation tool could be revived and missing features could be added.

  From an ABI source code could be generated that would allow client libraries
  to call Cadence programs in a type-safe way.

- Allow import statements to specify the hash of the imported contract

  Cadence programs can import other programs.
  However, contract code might change, which could lead to bugs and even security problems.

  Cadence should provide a way to specify the expected hash of the imported contract
  in the import statement, so that the runtime can check that the actual hash matches
  the expected hash, and abort execution if it does not.

- Add conversion semantics to failable casting operator `as`?

  Cadence's failable casting operator `as?` should allow conversion
  just like the static casting operator `as` does.

- Overloading based on argument labels

  Cadence should allow overloading of functions and initializers based on argument labels.
  For example, this enables initializers which initialize some fields with default values.

  This is sane from a developer/user perspective, as it's clear at the call-site
  which function is called.

- Set data structure

  Cadence should provide a built-in set collection type. It would only be useful for value types,
  as resource types are already guaranteed to be unique within the whole system,
  and lots of set operators donâ€™t make sense for a set of resources.

  Built-in set types are fairly common in other languages, including literal syntax.

  In Python the literal syntax is curly braces.
  However, curly braces are also used for dictionaries, so `{1}` is a set,
  but `{}` is considered an empty dictionary.

  Nim also [has sets and uses braces for set literals](https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#types-set-type).

  Swift also [has sets](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/set)
  and the array literal syntax is reused
  (in fact, there is a mechanism to initialize arbitrary data structures with built-in literals,
  see [ExpressibleByArrayLiteral](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/expressiblebyarrayliteral)).

  Another thing to note about Swift: The syntax for data structure types reflects
  the syntax of literals: The array `[1]` has type `[Int]`,
  the dictionary `["two": 2]` has type `[String: Int]`.
  We could adopt this and add curly braces for sets.

- XOR operator

  Cadence should provide an XOR operator (`^`): logical for booleans and bitwise for integers.

- Loose mode / Gradual typing

  Cadence should have a mode that does not require type annotations and which performs
  fewer or no type checks.
  This allows the fast development of a program and progressively moving towards
  a more correct and safe implementation of it.

  Gradual typing enables developers to write a program without types
  and gradually type parts of the program.
  It has been proposed to be retrofitted to a few languages,
  and TypeScript really succeed here, so we should learn from it.
  However, its type-system is also unsound and it is very complex/feature-full,
  so we might not want to adopt everything whole-heartedly.

- Destructuring, pattern matching

  Cadence should provide a way to destructure and pattern match values.
  This would reduce boilerplate and improve safety and readability.

  Destructuring is basically a special case (one pattern) of pattern matching:
  accessing elements of a data structure (e.g. array, dictionary, struct, etc.)
  and binding it to identifiers in a variable/constant declaration.

  Pattern matching would be an enhancement allowing this functionality in the cases of a switch-statement.

- Distinct types

  Cadence should offer a way to declare distinct types,
  i.e., types that are derived from an existing type,
  but are not compatible with them could improve safety.
  For example, instead of using a string for a person's ID,
  a new type `PersonID` can be derived from string.
  This improves safety, as for example another random string (e.g. a first name)
  can't be confused as a person's ID.

  This is similar to [`newtype` in Haskell](https://wiki.haskell.org/Newtype)
  and [`NewType` in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#newtype).

- Add `Hashable` interface

  Cadence should allow user types to be used as dictionary keys.

  Implement the `Hashable` interface as described in the documentation.

- Add `Equatable` interface

  Cadence should allow user types to be equated,
  i.e. used with the equality operators `==` and `!=`.

  Implement the `Equatable` interface as described in the documentation.

- Optimize value semantics, perform copy-on-write

  Cadence has pass-by-value semantics.

  Optimize the performance by reducing the number of actual copies through copy-on-write.

- Built-in types to work with timestamps and durations

  Cadence should offer two new built in types: `Timestamp` and `Duration`,
  each representing the number of seconds since the Unix Epoch (00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970).

  These types would work almost the same as the `Int64` type, with the following extra rules:

  - `Timestamp`s
    - Can not be multiplied or divided with each other, or with integers.
    - You can add a timestamp and a duration together, and the result is a timestamp.
    - You can subtract a duration from a timestamp, and the result is a timestamp.

  - `Duration`s:
    - Can not be multiplied or divided with each other, but can be multipled by, or divided by,   `Int64` (which results in a duration)

    - Can be added or subtracted with each other, which results in a duration

  In addition, Cadence should provide the built-in duration constants `second`, `minute`, `hour`, `day` and `year`.
  Ideally, there would be a way to create a timestamp constant from an ISO-8601 string (e.g. `2020-03-13T19:52:43Z`),
  with only the UTC timezone allowed (indicated with the optional trailing `Z`).

  Another idea is to use the `Fix64` type, which gives us a date range of approximately
  1500AD - 2250AD, with accuracy to 100 millionth of a second.
  Obviously, that kind of accuracy is not needed, and a higher date range seems useful.
  On the other hand, having some level of sub-second accuracy
  might be useful in the blocktime field,
  given that the block rate might be >1 block/sec at some point.

- Re-entrancy

  Cadence should provide means to prevent re-entrancy attacks.
  To achieve this, enforce that borrows are exclusive.
  In a transition period, warn instead of aborting,
  and analyze behaviour on chain, as well as ask the community to report cases.

  This is similar to [Swift's Exclusivity Enforcement](https://swift.org/blog/swift-5-exclusivity/).

- Contexts

  Cadence should provide a way to execute a block of code that can potentially abort/fail/revert,
  and recover from the failure.

  This is similar to a try-catch block, however, on failure,
  storage changes and in-memory state changes (!) would reverted.

- Improve Static Analysis

  Cadence should offer means to make it statically analyzable.

  For example, a subset of pre and post-conditions of functions and transactions
  could be statically checked.

- Improve the development experience in editors by improving the Language Server

  - [Add support for code actions](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/532),
    e.g. renaming, refactoring, code changes (switch access modifier),
    add return type through return statement, etc.

  - [Support more code-suggestions/auto-completions](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/531)

- Extend paths

  Cadence should [allow values like types, numbers, and addresses to be included in paths](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/538).
  Currently paths only consist of a domain and an identifier.
