const blockTypeHeightFieldDocString = `
The height of the block.

If the blockchain is viewed as a tree with the genesis block at the root, the height of a node is the number of edges between the node and the genesis block
`

const blockTypeViewFieldDocString = `
The view of the block.

It is a detail of the consensus algorithm. It is a monotonically increasing integer and counts rounds in the consensus algorithm. Since not all rounds result in a finalized block, the view number is strictly greater than or equal to the block height
`

const blockTypeTimestampFieldDocString = `
The ID of the block.

It is essentially the hash of the block
`

const blockTypeIdFieldDocString = `
The timestamp of the block.

Unix timestamp of when the proposer claims it constructed the block.

NOTE: It is included by the proposer, there are no guarantees on how much the time stamp can deviate from the true time the block was published.
Consider observing blocksâ€™ status changes off-chain yourself to get a more reliable value
