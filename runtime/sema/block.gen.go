The height of the block.

If the blockchain is viewed as a tree with the genesis block at the root,
the height of a node is the number of edges between the node and the genesis block

The view of the block.

It is a detail of the consensus algorithm. It is a monotonically increasing integer and counts rounds in the consensus algorithm.
Since not all rounds result in a finalized block, the view number is strictly greater than or equal to the block height
