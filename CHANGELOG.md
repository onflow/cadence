## What's Changed
### üí• Go API Breaking Chance

The API of the Go package `cadence` improved. These changes only impact users of the Go API of Cadence. These changes had no impact on the language itself or programs written in Cadence.

- It is no longer possible to access composite fields (`cadence.Composite` types, like `cadence.Struct`, `cadence.Resource`, etc) by index. The `Fields` field got unexported.

  <details>
  <summary>Details:</summary>

    - Accessing fields by index makes code dependent on the order of fields in the Cadence type definition, which may change (order is insignificant)
    - The order of fields of composite values returned from the chain (e.g. from a script) is planned to be made deterministic in the future. The Go API change prepares for this upcoming encoding change. For more details see https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/2952
    - Accessing fields by name improves code, as it removes possibilities for extracting field values incorrectly (by wrong index)
    - There are two ways to get the value of a composite field:
        - If multiple field values are needed from the composite value, 
        use `cadence.FieldsMappedByName`, which returns a `map[string]cadence.Value`.
            
            For example:
            
            ```go
            const fooTypeSomeIntFieldName = "someInt"
            const fooTypeSomeStringFieldName = "someString"
            
            // decodeFooEvent decodes the Cadence event:
            //
            //	event Foo(someInt: Int, someString: String)
            //
            // It returns an error if the event does not have the expected fields.
            func decodeFooEvent(event cadence.Event) (someInt cadence.Int, someString cadence.String, err error) {
            	fields := cadence.FieldsMappedByName(event)
            
            	var ok bool
            
            	someIntField := fields[fooTypeSomeIntFieldName]
            	someInt, ok = someIntField.(cadence.Int)
            	if !ok {
            		return cadence.Int{}, "", fmt.Errorf("wrong field type: expected Int, got %T", someInt)
            	}
            	
            	someStringField := fields[fooTypeSomeStringFieldName]
            	someString, ok = someStringField.(cadence.String)
            	if !ok {
            		return cadence.Int{}, "", fmt.Errorf("wrong field type: expected String, got %T", someString)
            	}
            	
            	return someInt, someString, nil
            }
            ```
            
        - If only a single field value is needed from the composite,
        use `cadence.SearchFieldByName`. As the name indicates, the function performs a linear search over all fields of the composite. Prefer `FieldsMappedByName` over repeated calls to `SearchFieldByName`.
        For example:
            
            ```go
            const fooTypeSomeIntFieldName = "someInt"
            
            // fooEventSomeIntField gets the value of the someInt field of the Cadence event:
            //
            //	event Foo(someInt: Int)
            //
            // It returns an error if the event does not have the expected field.
            func fooEventSomeIntField(event cadence.Event) (cadence.Int, error) {
            	someIntField := cadence.SearchFieldByName(event, fooTypeSomeIntFieldName)
            	someInt, ok := someIntField.(cadence.Int)
            	if !ok {
            		return cadence.Int{}, fmt.Errorf("wrong field type: expected Int, got %T", someInt)
            	}
            	return someInt, nil
            }
            
            ```
  </details>
            
- `cadence.GetFieldByName` got renamed to `cadence.SearchFieldByName` to make it clear that the function performs a linear search
- `cadence.GetFieldsMappedByName` got renamed to `cadence.FieldsMappedByName`, to better follow common Go style / naming guides, e.g. https://google.github.io/styleguide/go/decisions#getters
- The convenience method `ToGoValue` of `cadence.Value`, which converts a `cadence.Value` into a Go value (if possible), got removed. Likewise, the convenience function `cadence.NewValue`, which constructs a new `cadence.Value` from the given Go value (if possible), got removed.

  <details>
  <summary>Details:</summary>

    - There are many different use cases and needs for methods that convert between Cadence and Go values. When attempting to convert an arbitrary Cadence value into a Go value, there is no "correct" Go type to return in all cases. Likewise, when attempting to convert an arbitrary Go value to Cadence, there might not be a ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù result type.
    - Developers might expect a certain Go type to be returned. For example, `ToGoValue` of `cadence.Struct` returned a Go slice, but some developers might assume and want a Go map; and `ToGoValue` of `cadence.Dictionary` returned a Go map, but did not account for the case where dictionary keys in Cadence might be types that are invalid in Go maps.
    - As the return type of `ToGoValue` is `any`, developers using the method need to cast to some expected Go type, and hope the returned value is what they expect.
    - Improvements in the implementation of `ToGoValue`, like in https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/2531, would have silently broken programs using the function, as the different return value would have no longer matched the developer‚Äôs expected type.
    - Even though these methods and functions got removed from the `cadence` package, developers can still perform the conversion that the `ToGoValue` methods performed. A future version of Cadence might re-introduce well-defined and strongly-typed conversion functions, that are also consistent with similar conversion functions in other languages (e.g. JavaScript SDK / FCL).
    - To see what the removed functions and methods did, have a look at the PR that removed them: https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/3291/files.
    - If you feel like Cadence should re-gain this functionality, please open a feature request, or even consider contributing them through pull requests

# [Language Server v0.26.0 (languageserver/v0.26.0)](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/releases/tag/languageserver/v0.26.0) - 12 Aug 2022

## üõ† Improvements
This release introduces general improvements to the Language server code base that can be categorized into:
- **Isolating Flow client**
The Flow client was extracted and exposed via an interface, that allows us to mock it out during testing and to encapsulate all the flow client logic. 
- **Simplifying the state management**
There was a couple of complexities removed from the LS, most notably how accounts are managed, previously the accounts were managed on network, using the contract to resolve names to addresses, which provided another state that was required to be synced between LS, client and blockchain. This was removed and encapsulated within the Flow client implementation and it only contains a simple list of accounts which can be listed to the client via API if needed (clearly marking currently active account) and also can be easily switched between active accounts. No setup is required.
- **Better error handling**
Commands were refactored in how they handle errors, previously each command had to handle the error and send the response to the client, now the errors are returned from the command layer to the server where the response is handled in once place:
- **Testing**
The unit test of each of the integration components were added as well as end-to-end tests testing all the commands.

# [v0.24 (Secure Cadence) (v0.24.0)](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/releases/tag/v0.24.0) - 07 Jun 2022

## What's Changed

The Secure Cadence milestone is focused on code-hardening and will enable the permissionless deployment of smart contracts on Mainnet. It is an important step in [our path to Stable Cadence](https://forum.onflow.org/t/the-path-to-stable-cadence/2702).

This required some breaking changes. You can read all about these changes and how to update your contracts in this forum post:
[Breaking changes coming with Secure Cadence release](https://forum.onflow.org/t/breaking-changes-coming-with-secure-cadence-release/3052)

While the focus was on securing Cadence, this release is also packed with many new features and improvements!

## üí• Breaking Changes

* Remove `PublicKey.isValid` by [@robert-e-davidson3](https://github.com/robert-e-davidson3) in https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/1273, https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/1454

  The `PublicKey` constructor now validates the public key data and aborts the program if it is invalid. 
  The `isValid` field was removed.

## ‚≠ê Features

* Add converter functions to produce path values from strings by [@dsainati1](https://github.com/dsainati1) in https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/1437, https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/1211

  Paths can now be constructed at run-time. The following path constructors were added:

  ```kotlin
  fun PublicPath(identifier: string): PublicPath?
  fun PrivatePath(identifier: string): PrivatePath?
  fun StoragePath(identifier: string): StoragePath?
  ```

  Each of these functions take an identifier and produce a path of the appropriate domain.
  For example, to construct a public path from a string:
  
  ```kotlin
  let pathID = "foo"
  let path = PublicPath(identifier: pathID) // is /public/foo
  ```

  For more information, see https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/language/accounts/#path-functions

* Add RLP decoding utility methods by [@ramtinms](https://github.com/ramtinms) in https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/1397, https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/1456

  Cadence now provides RLP decoding functions through the built-in contract `RLP`.
  It provides the following functions for decoding strings and lists:

  ```kotlin
  fun decodeString(_ input: [UInt8]): [UInt8]
  fun decodeList(_ input: [UInt8]): [[UInt8]]
  ```

  For more information, see https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/language/built-in-functions/#rlp

* Add index to for loop by [@dsainati1](https://github.com/dsainati1) in https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/1216, https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/1452

  For-loops may now declare an indexing variable:

  ```kotlin
  for index, element in array {
      // ...
  }
  ```

* Add BLS-specific crypto functions by [@dsainati1](https://github.com/dsainati1) in https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/1236, https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/1250, https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/1430

  `PublicKey` gained a new function to verify a proof-of-possession:
  
  ```kotlin
  fun verifyPoP(_ proof: [UInt8]): Bool
  ```

  Cadence now provides BLS-specific functions through the built-in contract `BLS`. 
  It provides the following functions:

  ```kotlin
  fun aggregateSignatures(_ signatures: [[UInt8]]): [UInt8]?
  fun aggregatePublicKeys(_ publicKeys: [PublicKey]): PublicKey?
  ```

  For more information, see https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/language/crypto/#bls

<a name="v0.20.0"></a>
# [v0.20.0](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/releases/tag/v0.20.0) - 17 Nov 2021

This release culminates a half-year effort to improve the Cadence storage layer, i.e. how Cadence values are stored in accounts, in particular arrays, dictionaries, and composite values. [@fxamacker](https://github.com/fxamacker) and [@ramtinms](https://github.com/ramtinms) designed and implemented completely new array and ordered map data structures, resulting in [atree](https://github.com/onflow/atree). These data structures are fast and scalable: they allow efficient access and allow efficient modifications to arrays and dictionaries with very large number of elements. [@turbolent](https://github.com/turbolent) and [@SupunS](https://github.com/SupunS) integrated this new library into Cadence. This new storage layer also fixed a bug in the resource `owner` field. Please see the breaking changes section for more details.

In addition, this release saw several feature and documentation contributions by new community members. Thank you!

## üí• Breaking Changes

- With the storage layer update, the `owner` field of resources is now implemented correctly, as originally designed:
  The field is only non-`nil` if the resource is currently in storage, and is always `nil` if the resource is on the stack.
  This breaking change is actually a bug fix, as the `owner` field was previously implemented incorrectly: After a resource was moved out of storage onto the stack, the `owner` field was still referring to the account the resource was stored in.

  Please ensure your Cadence programs do not rely on the broken behaviour and update them if needed.

  For example, in a function that is passed a resource as an argument, the resource's `owner` field will always be `nil`:

  ```kotlin
  pub fun deposit(token: @NonFungibleToken.NFT) {
      // token.owner is always nil!
      // ...
  }
  ```

- Add limit on call stack depth ([#1138](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/1138)) [@SupunS](https://github.com/SupunS)

# [v0.16.0](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/releases/tag/v0.16.0) - 18 May 2021


## üí• Breaking Changes

- Add new crypto features ([#852](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/852)) [@SupunS](https://github.com/SupunS)

  Renamed the `ECDSA_Secp256k1` signature algorithm to `ECDSA_secp256k1`.

  Please update existing contracts, transactions, and scripts to use the new name.

- Remove the high-level storage API ([#877](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/877)) [@turbolent](https://github.com/turbolent)

  The internal interface's `SetCadenceValue` function was removed.

  This change does not affect Cadence programs (contracts, transactions, scripts).

## ‚≠ê Features

- Add non-local type inference for expressions ([#875](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/875)) [@SupunS](https://github.com/SupunS)

  The type of most declarations and expressions is now inferred in a uni-directional way, instead of only locally.

  For example, this allows the following declarations to type-check without having to add static casts:

  ```kotlin
  let numbers: [Int8] = [1, 2, 3]
  let nestedNumbers: [[Int8]] = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
  let numberNames: {Int64: String} = {0: "zero", 1: "one"}
  let sum: Int8 = 1 + 2
  ```

- Add new crypto features ([#852](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/852)) [@SupunS](https://github.com/SupunS)

  **Hash Algorithms**

  - Added [KMAC128_BLS_BLS12_381 hashing algorithm](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/language/crypto/#hashing-algorithms)): `HashAlgorithm.KMAC128_BLS_BLS12_381`

  **Signature Algorithms**

  - Added [BLS_BLS12_381 signature algorithm](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/language/crypto/#signature-algorithms): `SignatureAlgorithm.BLS_BLS12_381`

  **`PublicKey` Type**

  - Added the field `let isValid: Bool`. For example:

    ```kotlin
    let publicKey = PublicKey(publicKey: [], signatureAlgorithm: SignatureAlgorithm.ECDSA_P256)

    let valid = publicKey.isValid
    ```

  - Added the function `verify`, which allows validating signatures:

    ```kotlin
    pub fun verify(
        signature: [UInt8],
        signedData: [UInt8],
        domainSeparationTag: String,
        hashAlgorithm: HashAlgorithm
    ): Bool
    ```

    For example:

    ```kotlin
    let valid = publicKey.verify(
        signature: [],
        signedData: [],
        domainSeparationTag: "something",
        hashAlgorithm: HashAlgorithm.SHA2_256
    )
    ```

  - Added the function `hashWithTag`, which allows hashing with a tag:

    ```kotlin
    pub fun hashWithTag(
        _ data: [UInt8],
        tag: string,
        algorithm: HashAlgorithm
    ): [UInt8]
    ```

# [v0.14.0](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/releases/tag/v0.14.0) - 15 Mar 2021

This release introduced a new [high-level Account Key API](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/language/accounts/) and improves the interpreter performance.
The current low-level Account Key API is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please switch to the new one.

The following example transaction demonstrates the functionality:

```kotlin
transaction {
	prepare(signer: AuthAccount) {
		let newPublicKey = PublicKey(
			publicKey: "010203".decodeHex(),
			signatureAlgorithm: SignatureAlgorithm.ECDSA_P256
		)

		// Add a key
		let addedKey = signer.keys.add(
			publicKey: newPublicKey,
			hashAlgorithm: HashAlgorithm.SHA3_256,
			weight: 100.0
		)


		// Retrieve a key
		let sameKey = signer.keys.get(keyIndex: addedKey.keyIndex)


		// Revoke a key
		signer.keys.revoke(keyIndex: addedKey.keyIndex)
	}
}
```

- Allow the Language Server to be debugged ([#663](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/663)) [@turbolent](https://github.com/turbolent)

## üí• Breaking Changes

The `Crypto` contract has changed in a backwards-incompatible way, so the types and values it declared could be used in the new Account Key API:

- The struct `Crypto.PublicKey` was replaced by the new built-in global struct `PublicKey`. 
  There is no need anymore to import the `Crypto` contract to work with public keys.

- The struct `Crypto.SignatureAlgorithm` was replaced with the new built-in global enum `SignatureAlgorithm`.
  There is no need anymore to import the `Crypto` contract to work with signature algorithms.

- The struct `Crypto.HashAlgorithm` was replaced with the new built-in global enum `HashAlgorithm`.
  There is no need anymore to import the `Crypto` contract to work with hash algorithms.

- The signature algorithm value `Crypto.ECDSA_Secp256k1` was replaced with the new built-in enum case `SignatureAlgorithm.ECDSA_Secp256k1`

- The signature algorithm value `Crypto.ECDSA_P256` was replaced with the new built-in enum case `SignatureAlgorithm.ECDSA_P256`

- The hash algorithm `Crypto.SHA3_256` was replaced with the new built-in enum case `HashAlgorithm.SHA3_256`

- The hash algorithm `Crypto.SHA2_256` was replaced with the new built-in enum case `HashAlgorithm.SHA2_256`

## üí• Breaking Changes

### Typed Paths ([#403](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/403))

Paths are now typed. Paths in the storage domain have type `StoragePath`, in the private domain `PrivatePath`, and in the public domain `PublicPath`.  `PrivatePath` and `PublicPath` are subtypes of `CapabilityPath`. Both `StoragePath` and `CapabilityPath` are subtypes of `Path`.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="3">Path</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">CapabilityPath</td>
    <td colspan="2" rowspan="2">StoragePath</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>PrivatePath</td>
    <td>PublicPath</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Storage API ([#403](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/403))

With paths being typed, it was possible to make the Storage API type-safer and easier to use: It is now statically checked if the correct type of path is given to a function, instead of at run-time, and therefore capability return types can now be non-optional.

The changes are as follows:

For `PublicAccount`:

- old: `fun getCapability<T>(_ path: Path): Capability<T>?` <br/>
  new: `fun getCapability<T>(_ path: PublicPath): Capability<T>`

- old: `fun getLinkTarget(_ path: Path): Path?` <br />
  new: `fun getLinkTarget(_ path: CapabilityPath): Path?`

For `AuthAccount`:

- old: `fun save<T>(_ value: T, to: Path)` <br />
  new: `fun save<T>(_ value: T, to: StoragePath)`

- old: `fun load<T>(from: Path): T?` <br />
  new: `fun load<T>(from: StoragePath): T?`

- old: `fun copy<T: AnyStruct>(from: Path): T?` <br />
  new: `fun copy<T: AnyStruct>(from: StoragePath): T?`

- old: `fun borrow<T: &Any>(from: Path): T?` <br />
  new: `fun borrow<T: &Any>(from: StoragePath): T?`

- old: `fun link<T: &Any>(_ newCapabilityPath: Path, target: Path): Capability<T>?` <br />
  new: `fun link<T: &Any>(_ newCapabilityPath: CapabilityPath, target: Path): Capability<T>?`

- old: `fun getCapability<T>(_ path: Path): Capability<T>?` <br/>
  new: `fun getCapability<T>(_ path: CapabilityPath): Capability<T>`

- old: `fun getLinkTarget(_ path: Path): Path?` <br />
  new: `fun getLinkTarget(_ path: CapabilityPath): Path?`

- old: `fun unlink(_ path: Path)` <br />
  new: `fun unlink(_ path: CapabilityPath)`

## ‚≠ê Features

- Add a hash function to the crypto contract ([#379](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/379))
- Added npm packages for components of Cadence. This eases the development of developer tools for Cadence:

  - `cadence-language-server`: The Cadence Language Server
  - `monaco-languageclient-cadence`: Language Server Protocol client for the the Monaco editor
  - `cadence-parser`: The Cadence parser

  In addition, there are also examples for the [language server](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/tree/master/npm-packages/cadence-language-server-demo) and the [parser](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/tree/master/npm-packages/cadence-parser-demo) that demonstrate the use of the packages.

- Add a command to the language server that allows getting the entry point (transaction or script) parameters ([#406](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/406))

## üõ† Improvements

- Allow references to be returned from from scripts ([#400](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/400))
- Panic with a dedicated error for out of bounds array index ([#396](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/396))

## üìñ Documentation

- Document resource identifiers ([#394](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/394))
- Document iteration over dictionary entries ([#399](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/399))

## üì¶ Dependencies

- The changes to the [CBOR library](https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor) have been [merged](https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor/pull/249), so [the `replace` statement that was necessary in the last release](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/releases/tag/v0.10.0) must be removed.

## üí• Breaking Changes

### Contract Deployment

This release adds support for deploying multiple contracts per account.
The API for deploying has changed:

- The functions `AuthAccount.setCode` and `AuthAccount.unsafeNotInitializingSetCode` were removed ([#390](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/390)).
- A [new contract management API](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/language/contracts/#deploying-updating-and-removing-contracts) has been added, which allows adding, updating, and removing multiple contracts per account ([#333](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/333), [#352](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/352)).

  See the [updated documentation](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/language/contracts/#deploying-updating-and-removing-contracts) for details and examples.

## ‚≠ê Features

### Enumerations

This release adds support for enumerations ([#344](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/344)).

For example, a days-of-the-week enum can be declared though:

```swift
enum Day: UInt8 {
    case Monday
    case Tuesday
    case Wednesday
    case Thursday
    case Friday
    case Saturday
    case Sunday
}
```

See the [documentation](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/language/enumerations/) for further details and examples.

### Switch Statement

This release adds support for switch statements ([#365](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/365)).

```swift
fun describe(number: Int): String {
    switch number {
    case 1:
        return "one"
    case 2:
        return "two"
    default:
        return "other"
    }
}
```

See the [documentation](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/language/control-flow/#switch) for further details and examples.

### Code Formatter

Development of a code formatter has started, in form of a plugin for Prettier ([#348](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/348)).
If you would like to contribute, please let us know!

## üõ† Improvements

- Limitations on data structure complexity are now enforced when decoding and also when encoding storage data, e.g number of array elements, number of dictionary entries, etc. ([#370](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/370))
- Using the force-unwrap operator on a non-optional is no longer an error, but a hint is reported suggesting the removal of the unnecessary operation ([#347](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/347))
- Language Server: The features requiring a Flow client connection are now optional. This allows using the language server in editors other than Visual Studio Code, such as Emacs, Vim, etc. ([#303](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/303))

## üêû Bug Fixes

- Fixed the encoding of bignums in storage ([#370](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/370))
- Fixed the timing of recording composite-type explicit-conformances ([#356](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/356))
- Added support for exporting and JSON encoding/decoding of type values and capabilities ([#374](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/374))
- Added support for exporting/importing and JSON encoding/decoding of path values ([#319](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/319))
- Fixed the handling of empty integer literals in the checker ([#354](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/354))
- Fixed the non-storable fields error ([#350](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/350))

## üìñ Documentation

- Added a [roadmap describing planned features and ideas](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) ([#367](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/367))
- Various documentation improvements ([#385](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/385)). Thanks to [@andrejtokarcik](https://github.com/andrejtokarcik) for contributing this!

## üì¶ Dependencies

This release depends on a fork of the [CBOR library](github.com/fxamacker/cbor/v2) that Cadence uses.
When importing Cadence in another Go codebase, add the following statement to the `go.mod` file:

```
replace github.com/fxamacker/cbor/v2 => github.com/turbolent/cbor/v2 v2.2.1-0.20200911003300-cac23af49154

## üõ† Improvements

- Improved support on Windows: Treat carriage returns as space ([#304](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/304))
- Improved JSON marshalling for more AST elements ([#292](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/292), [#286](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/286))
- Recursively check if assignment target expression is valid, don't copy returned values ([#288](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/288))
- Consider existing prefix when suggesting completion items ([#285](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/285))
- Include available declarations in "not declared" error ([#280](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/280))
- Enforce the requirement for types to be storable in more places:
  - Transaction/script parameter types ([#305](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/305))
  - Script return type ([#291](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/291))
  - Arguments passed to the account `load` and `store` functions ([#251](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/251))

  Previously, using non-storable failed at run-time, now the programs are rejected statically.

## ‚≠ê Features

- Add a version constant ([#289](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/289))
- Language Server: Include error notes as related information in diagnostic ([#276](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/276))

## üêû Bug Fixes

- Don't return an error when a location type is not supported ([#290](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/290))
- Handle incomplete types in checker ([#284](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/284))
- Fix the suggestion in the error when an interface is used as a type ([#281](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/281))

## üìñ Documentation

- Brought the documentation up-to-date, include all new language features and API changes ([#275](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/275), [#277](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/277), [#279](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/279))

## üí• Breaking Changes

- Arguments passed to `cadence.Value#WithType` are now typed as pointers (`*cadence.Type`) rather than values (`cadence.Type`)

  Example:

  ```go
  myEventType := cadence.EventType{...})

  // this üëá 
  myEvent := cadence.NewEvent(...).WithType(myEventType)

  // changes to this üëá 
  myEvent := cadence.NewEvent(...).WithType(&myEventType)
  ```

<a name="v0.7.0"></a>
# [v0.7.0](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/releases/tag/v0.7.0) - 05 Aug 2020

This release contains a lot of improvements to the language server, which improve the development experience in the Visual Studio Code extension, and will also soon be integrated into the Flow Playground.

## ‚≠ê Features

- Added member completion to the language server ([#257](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/257))
  - Insert the argument list when completing functions ([#268](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/268))
  - Offer keyword snippets ([#268](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/268))
- Enabled running the language server in the browser by compiling it to WebAssembly ([#242](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/242))
- Added support for docstrings to the parser ([#246](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/246), [#255](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/255))
- Added support for pragmas to the parser ([#239](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/239))
- Started a source compatibility suite ([#226](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/226), [#270](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/270)).

  Cadence will be regularly checked for compatibility with existing code to ensure it does not regress in source compatibility and performance. As a start, the [Fungible Token standard](https://github.com/onflow/flow-ft) and [Non-Fungible Token standard](https://github.com/onflow/flow-ft) repositories are checked.

  Consider requesting your repository to be included in the compatibility suite!
- Added a simple minifier ([#252](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/252))

## üõ† Improvements

- Made embedding the language server easier ([#274](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/274), [#262](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/262))
- Extended the JSON serialization for Cadence values and types ([#260](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/260), [#264](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/264), [#265](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/265), [#266](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/266), [#271](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/271), [#273](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/273)) 
- Improved conformance checking ([#245](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/245)). Made return types covariant, i.e. allow subtypes for return types of functions to satisfy interface conformance.


## üí• Breaking Changes

- Made strings immutable ([#269](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/269))
- Moved the Visual Studio Code extension to a new repository: <https://github.com/onflow/vscode-flow> ([#244](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/244))
- Added a magic prefix to stored data ([#236](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/236)). 
  This allows versioning the data. Existing data without a prefix is migrated automatically
- Changed the order in which fields in values and types are exported to declaration order ([#272](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/272))

## üêû Bug Fixes

- Removed the service account from the list of usable accounts in the language server ([#261](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/261)) 
- Fixed a parsing ambiguity for return types ([#267](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/267))
- Fixed non-composite reference subtyping ([#253](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/253))

## üß∞ Maintenance

- Removed the old parser ([#249](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/249))

[Changes][v0.7.0]


<a name="v0.6.0"></a>
# [v0.6.0](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/releases/tag/v0.6.0) - 14 Jul 2020

This is a small release with some bug fixes, internal improvements, and one breaking change for code that embeds Cadence. 

## üí• Breaking Changes

- Removed the unused `controller` parameter from the storage interface methods:

  - `func GetValue(owner, controller, key []byte) (value []byte, err error)` 
    ‚Üí `func GetValue(owner, key []byte) (value []byte, err error)`

  - `SetValue(owner, controller, key, value []byte) (err error)`
    ‚Üí `SetValue(owner, key, value []byte) (err error)`

  - `ValueExists(owner, controller, key []byte) (exists bool, err error)`
    ‚Üí `ValueExists(owner, key []byte) (exists bool, err error)`

  This is only a breaking change in the implementation of Cadence, i.e for code that embeds Cadence, not in the Cadence language, i.e. for users of Cadence.

## ‚≠ê Features

- Added an optional callback for writes with high-level values to the interface:

  ```go
  type HighLevelStorage interface {

	  // HighLevelStorageEnabled should return true
	  // if the functions of HighLevelStorage should be called,
	  // e.g. SetCadenceValue
	  HighLevelStorageEnabled() bool

	  // SetCadenceValue sets a value for the given key in the storage, owned by the given account.
	  SetCadenceValue(owner Address, key string, value cadence.Value) (err error)
  }
  ```

  This is a feature in the implementation of Cadence, i.e for code that embeds Cadence, not in the Cadence language, i.e. for users of Cadence.

## üõ† Improvements

- Don't report an error for a restriction with an invalid type
- Record the occurrences of types. This enables the "Go to definition" feature for types in the language server
- Parse member expressions without a name. This allows the checker to run. This will enable adding code completion support or members in the future.

## üêû Bug Fixes

- Fixed a crash when checking the invocation of a function on an undeclared variable
- Fixed handling of functions in composite values in the JSON-CDC encoding
- Fixed a potential stack overflow when checking member storability

A new built-in contract `Crypto` was added for performing cryptographic operations.

The contract can be imported using `import Crypto`.

This first iteration provides support for validating signatures, with an API that supports multiple signatures and weighted keys.

For example, to verify two signatures with equal weights for some signed data:

```swift
let keyList = Crypto.KeyList()

let publicKeyA = Crypto.PublicKey(
    publicKey:
        "db04940e18ec414664ccfd31d5d2d4ece3985acb8cb17a2025b2f1673427267968e52e2bbf3599059649d4b2cce98fdb8a3048e68abf5abe3e710129e90696ca".decodeHex(),
    signatureAlgorithm: Crypto.ECDSA_P256
)
keyList.add(
    publicKeyA,
    hashAlgorithm: Crypto.SHA3_256,
    weight: 0.5
)

let publicKeyB = Crypto.PublicKey(
    publicKey:
        "df9609ee588dd4a6f7789df8d56f03f545d4516f0c99b200d73b9a3afafc14de5d21a4fc7a2a2015719dc95c9e756cfa44f2a445151aaf42479e7120d83df956".decodeHex(),
    signatureAlgorithm: Crypto.ECDSA_P256
)
keyList.add(
    publicKeyB,
    hashAlgorithm: Crypto.SHA3_256,
    weight: 0.5
)

let signatureSet = [
    Crypto.KeyListSignature(
        keyIndex: 0,
        signature:
            "8870a8cbe6f44932ba59e0d15a706214cc4ad2538deb12c0cf718d86f32c47765462a92ce2da15d4a29eb4e2b6fa05d08c7db5d5b2a2cd8c2cb98ded73da31f6".decodeHex()
    ),
    Crypto.KeyListSignature(
        keyIndex: 1,
        signature:
            "bbdc5591c3f937a730d4f6c0a6fde61a0a6ceaa531ccb367c3559335ab9734f4f2b9da8adbe371f1f7da913b5a3fdd96a871e04f078928ca89a83d841c72fadf".decodeHex()
    )
]

// "foo", encoded as UTF-8, in hex representation
let signedData = "666f6f".decodeHex()

let isValid = keyList.isValid(
    signatureSet: signatureSet,
    signedData: signedData
)
```

### Run-time Types

The type `Type` was added to represent types at run-time.

To create a type value, use the constructor function `Type<T>()`, which accepts the static type as a type argument.

This is similar to e.g. `T.self` in Swift, `T::class` in Kotlin, and `T.class` in Java.

For example, to represent the type `Int` at run-time:

```swift
let intType: Type = Type<Int>()
```

This works for both built-in and user-defined types. For example, to get the type value for a resource:

```swift
resource Collectible {}

let collectibleType = Type<@Collectible>()
```

The function `fun isInstance(_ type: Type): Bool` can be used to check if a value has a certain type:

```swift
let collectible <- create Collectible()
let collectibleType = Type<@Collectible>()
let result = collectible.isInstance(collectibleType)
```

For example, this allows implementing a marketplace sale resource:

```swift
pub resource SimpleSale {

    pub var objectForSale: @AnyResource?
    pub let priceForObject: UFix64
    pub let requiredCurrency: Type
    pub let paymentReceiver: Capability<&{FungibleToken.Receiver}>

    init(
        objectForSale: @AnyResource,
        priceForObject: UFix64,
        requiredCurrency: Type,
        paymentReceiver: Capability<&{FungibleToken.Receiver}>
    ) {
        self.objectForSale <- objectForSale
        self.priceForObject = priceForObject
        self.requiredCurrency = requiredCurrency
        self.paymentReceiver = paymentReceiver
    }

    destroy() {
        destroy self.objectForSale
    }

    pub fun buyObject(purchaseAmount: @FungibleToken.Vault): @AnyResource {
        pre {
            self.objectForSale != nil
            purchaseAmount.balance >= self.priceForObject
            purchaseAmount.isInstance(self.requiredCurrency)
        }

        let receiver = self.paymentReceiver.borrow()
            ?? panic("failed to borrow payment receiver capability")

        receiver.deposit(from: <-purchaseAmount)
        let objectForSale <- self.objectForSale <- nil
        return <-objectForSale
    }
}
```

### New Parser

The existing parser was replaced by a new implementation, completely written from scratch, producing the same result as the old parser.

It is significantly faster than the old parser. For example, the following benchmark shows the difference for parsing all fungible and non-fungible token contracts and example transactions:

```sh
$ go run ./cmd/parse -bench ../../flow-{n,}ft/{contracts,transactions}/*

```

The new parser also provides better error messages and will allow us to provide even better error messages in the future.

The new parser is enabled by default ‚Äì if you discover any problems or regressions, please report them!

### Typed Capabilities

Capabilities now accept an optional type argument, the reference type the capability should be borrowed as.

If a type argument is provided, it will be used for `borrow` and `check` calls, so there is no need to provide a type argument for the calls anymore.

The function `getCapability` now also accepts an optional type argument, and returns a typed capability if one is provided.

For example, the following two functions have the same behaviour:

```swift
fun cap1(): &Something? {
  // The type annotation for `cap` is only added for demonstration purposes,
  // it can also be omitted, because it can be inferred from the value
  let cap: Capability = getAccount(0x1).getCapability(/public/something)!
  return cap.borrow<&Something>()
}

fun cap2(): &Something? {
  // The type annotation for `cap` is only added for demonstration purposes,
  // it can also be omitted, because it can be inferred from the value
  let cap: Capability<&Something> =
      getAccount(0x1).getCapability<&Something>(/public/something)!
  return cap.borrow()
}
```

Prefer a typed capability over a non-typed one to reduce uses / borrows to a simple `.borrow()`, instead of having to repeatedly mention the borrowed type.

### Parameters for Scripts

Just like transactions, the `main` functions of scripts can now have parameters.

For example, a script that can be passed an integer and a string, and which logs both values, can be written as:

```swift
pub fun main(x: Int, y: String) {
    log(x)
    log(y)
}
```

### Standard Library

The function `fun toString(): String` was added to all number types and addresses. It returns the textual representation of the type. A future version of Cadence will add this function to more types.

The function `fun toBytes(): [UInt8]` was added to `Address`. It returns the byte representation of the address.

The function `fun toBigEndianBytes(): [UInt8]` was added to all number types. It returns the big-endian byte representation of the number value.

## üêû Bug Fixes

- Fixed the checking of return statements:
  A missing return value is now properly reported
- Fixed the checking of function invocations:
  Resources are temporarily moved into the invoked function
- Disabled caching of top-level programs (transactions, scripts)
- Fixed the comparison of optional values
- Fixed parsing of unpadded fixed point numbers
  in the JSON encoding of Cadence values (JSON-CDC)

## üí• Breaking Changes

### Field Types

Fields which have a non-storable type are now rejected:

Non-storable types are:

- Functions (e.g. `((Int): Bool)`)
- Accounts (`AuthAccount` / `PublicAccount`)
- Transactions
- `Void`

A future version will also make references non-storable. Instead of storing a reference, store a capability and borrow it to acquire a reference.
### Byte Arrays

Cadence now represents all byte arrays as `[UInt8]` rather than `[Int]`. This affects the following functions:

- `String.decodeHex(): [Int]` => `String.decodeHex(): [UInt8]`
- `AuthAccount.addPublicKey(publicKey: [Int])` => `AuthAccount.addPublicKey(publicKey: [UInt8])`
- `AuthAccount.setCode(code: [Int])` => `AuthAccount.setCode(code: [UInt8])`

However, array literals such as the following will still be inferred as `[Int]`, meaning that they can't be used directly:

```swift
myAccount.addPublicKey([1, 2, 3])
```

Consider using `String.decodeHex()` for now until type inference has been improved.


[Changes][v0.5.0]


<a name="v0.4.0"></a>
# [v0.4.0](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/releases/tag/v0.4.0) - 02 Jun 2020

## üí• Breaking Changes

- The `AuthAccount` constructor now requires a `payer` parameter, from which the account creation fee is deducted. The `publicKeys` and `code` parameters were removed.

## ‚≠ê Features

- Added the function `unsafeNotInitializingSetCode` to `AuthAccount` which, like `setCode`, updates the account's code but does not create a new contract object or invoke its initializer. This function can be used to upgrade account code without overwriting the existing stored contract object.

  ‚ö†Ô∏è This is potentially unsafe because no data migration is performed. For example, changing a field's type results in undefined behaviour (i.e. could lead to the execution being aborted).

## üêû Bug Fixes

- Fixed variable shadowing for-in identifier to shadow outer scope ([#72](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/72))
- Fixed order of declaring conformances and usages
- Fixed detection of resource losses in invocation of optional chaining result


[Changes][v0.4.0]


<a name="v0.3.0"></a>
# [v0.3.0](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/releases/tag/v0.3.0) - 26 May 2020

## üí• Breaking Changes

- Dictionary values which are resources are now stored in separate storage keys. This is transparent to programs, so is not breaking on a program level, but on the integration level.
- The state encoding was switched from Gob to CBOR. This is transparent to programs, so is not breaking on a program level, but on the integration level.
- The size of account addresses was reduced from 160 bits to 64 bits 

## ‚≠ê Features

- Added bitwise operations
- Added support for caching of program ASTs
- Added metrics
- Block info can be queried now

## üõ† Improvements

- Unnecessary writes are now avoided by tracking modifications
- Improved access modifier checks
- Improved the REPL
- Decode and validate transaction arguments
- Work on a new parser has started and is almost complete

## üêû Bug Fixes

- Fixed account code updated 
- Fixed the destruction of arrays
- Fixed type requirements
- Implemented modulo for `[U]Fix64`, fix modulo with negative operands
- Implemented division for `[U]Fix64`
- Fixed the `flow.AccountCodeUpdated` event
- Fixed number conversion
- Fixed function return checking
