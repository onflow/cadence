<a id="v1.7.0"></a>
# [v1.7.0](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/releases/tag/v1.7.0) - 2025-09-08

The Cadence v1.7.0 release marks a major step forward for Cadence. This upgrade delivers powerful new features that make Cadence more precise, more consistent, and more approachable for both developers and AI agents. With improvements ranging from higher-precision numeric types to more descriptive, AI-friendly error messages, Cadence v1.7.0 strengthens its position as the most developer-friendly smart contract language in Web3.  

The upgrade advances the Cadence roadmap across three key dimensions: developer experience, consistency and precision in financial workloads, and AI-powered autonomy. Together, these improvements ensure that building on Flow with Cadence is faster, safer, and more aligned with the future of agent-assisted development.  

## Introducing Fix128 and UFix128 for high-precision math

Cadence extends its fixed-point number system with Fix128 and UFix128, 128-bit fixed-point types that support precision up to 24 decimal places. Until now, developers relied on Fix64/UFix64, which are limited to eight decimal places. For many financial workloads such as interest accrual, risk modeling, and per-second rate calculations, this level of precision could fall short and force developers to manually convert values into scaled integers, which could introduce errors. The new 128-bit types expand numeric range while dramatically increasing fractional precision (24 decimal places vs eight), enabling accurate, high-resolution financial computations without custom math scaffolding. All values from Fix64/UFix64 convert losslessly to their 128-bit counterparts. Converting in the other direction can result in a range error, which will abort the transaction, and/or lost precision, which developers must handle explicitly, hence errors cannot go unnoticed.

This is the implementation of [FLIP 341: Add 128-bit fixed-point types to Cadence](https://github.com/onflow/flips/blob/main/cadence/20250815-128-bit-fixed-point-types.md).

On Ethereum, tokens and DeFi protocols typically represent fractional values by storing large integers alongside a `decimals` field (e.g. 18), leaving rounding and precision management to application code. Cadence eliminates this burden by providing fixed-point types natively at both 64-bit and 128-bit precision, significantly reducing rounding-related errors in application code.  

### Example:

### Solidity (integer math with decimals)  

```solidity
// ERC-20 token with 18 decimals
uint8 public constant decimals = 18;  

// Balance stored as integer with scaling
uint256 public balance = 1500 * (10 ** decimals);  
// balance represents "1500.000000000000000000"

// Annual interest rate, represented as integer with scaling
// 5% = 0.05, so store 0.05 * 1e18
uint256 public yearlyRate = 5 * (10 ** 16);  

// Seconds in a year
uint256 public constant SECONDS_PER_YEAR = 31_536_000;  

// Per-second interest rate, using integer division
uint256 public perSecondRate = yearlyRate / SECONDS_PER_YEAR;  

// Updated balance after one second (simplified)
uint256 public updated = balance * (10**18 + perSecondRate) / 10**18;
```

### Cadence (native fixed-point types)
```cadence
let preciseBalance: UFix128 = 1500.0

let yearlyRate: UFix128 = 0.05   // 5% interest
let perSecondRate = yearlyRate / 31536000.0  // seconds in a year

let updated = preciseBalance * (1.0 + perSecondRate)
```

## Fix numeric type rounding inconsistency  

In the same vein as introducing higher-precision fixed-point numbers, Cadence has also unified the rounding behavior of its numeric types to remove inconsistencies. Previously, `Fix64` and large integer types like `Int128` and `Int256` used Euclidean division semantics, which produced different results for negative values compared to smaller integer types. With this change, all numeric types, including `Fix64`, now consistently use truncation when handling division of negative numbers. This ensures predictable and uniform arithmetic across the language, reducing surprises for developers.

This is the implementation of [FLIP 342: Fix numeric type rounding inconsistency](https://github.com/onflow/flips/blob/main/cadence/20250828-Fix-number-type-division-inconsistancy.md)

### Example  

Before:  
```cadence
Fix64(-0.00000005) / Fix64(2.0) == Fix64(-0.00000003)
```

Now:
```cadence
Fix64(-0.00000005) / Fix64(2.0) == Fix64(-0.00000002)
```

## Descriptive, AI- and human-friendly Cadence errors  

Cadence already lends itself well to AI assistance, and this release strengthens that foundation by making compiler and linter errors far more descriptive and actionable. In the past, many errors such as those triggered by deprecated pre-1.0 keywords like `pub` only stated what was invalid, without suggesting how to fix it or linking to migration notes. This left both developers and AI agents without enough context to resolve issues automatically.  

Error messages have now been rewritten to explain the cause, suggest concrete fixes, and link directly to reference documentation. For example:  

Before:  
```cadence
pub fun foo() {}
// error: 'pub' is no longer a valid access keyword
```

Now:
```cadence
pub fun foo() {}
// error: 'pub' is no longer a valid access keyword
// note: replace with 'access(all)' for the same effect
// see: https://developers.flow.com/cadence/migration-guide
```
These enriched messages are also exposed through the Cadence language server, so IDEs and agent-based tools like Cursor can automatically apply the recommended fix, follow the link, and validate the change. The result is faster feedback, fewer trips to documentation, and a smoother path for both humans and AI agents working with Cadence.


## Import Aliasing
Previously, developers could not import two contracts with the same name in the same scope, which led to conflicts and forced duplication of code when working with multiple contracts such as different token implementations. To address this, Cadence now supports import aliasing, allowing developers to assign custom names to imported contracts. For example,
```cadence
import FUSD as FUSD1 from 0x02
import FUSD as FUSD2 from 0x03
```
This reduces code duplication, prevents naming conflicts, and improves readability. It is the implementation of [FLIP 314: Import Aliasing](https://github.com/onflow/flips/blob/main/cadence/20241212-import-aliasing.md).


## Cadence Runtime Transition: Interpreter → Compiler & VM

Cadence is progressing from its current interpreter to a new compiler and virtual machine. Historically, programs were executed by an interpreter that traverses the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), which enabled rapid language evolution but limited runtime performance. With the compiler, Cadence programs are translated into a lower-level bytecode executed by a dedicated VM. This reduces AST overhead for improved performance and establishes a unified runtime that simplifies backward compatibility, since contracts from different Cadence versions compile to a common instruction set. Existing smart contracts continue to function without modification as the language evolves. See [here](https://forum.flow.com/t/cadence-compilation/7060) for more information.

Once complete, the new compiler/VM backend will be deployed in an upcoming release, opening the door to performance gains and a more flexible path to long-term language evolution. Developers do not need to change how they write or deploy contracts. Compilation occurs automatically within the Cadence execution runtime.

### Key updates in this release:

### Full compiler and VM implementation

Implementation of all Cadence language features in the compiler and VM is now complete.

### Compatibility verification

Key book-keeping functions have been validated, including fee deduction, account storage limit checks, and minimum account balance checks. Executing these paths with the compiler and VM yields results identical to the interpreter. Significant progress has also been made on the correctness of user transaction execution, which remains the primary focus going forward.

### Performance improvements

Early benchmarks already show meaningful performance gains, establishing a solid foundation for further optimization.

# [v1.0.0](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/releases/tag/v1.0.0) - 2024-09-26

We are excited to announce the release of **Cadence v1.0**! 🎉 

Starting with this release, there will be no more planned breaking changes going forward! 🚀 

Reflecting two years of work since the last major milestone in 2022, [v0.24 (Secure Cadence)](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/releases/tag/v0.24.0), and the culmination of five years of work since the inception of Cadence in 2019, Cadence 1.0 is a milestone marking several significant enhancements. This release introduces full forward compatibility, enhanced composability through Attachments, and significant performance improvements. 

We would like to **thank all contributors and community members** for their great feedback and amazing contributions – this would have not been possible without you! 🙇

# 💫 New features

## Attachments

[Attachments](https://cadence-lang.org/docs/language/attachments) allow developers to extend a struct or resource type (even one that they did not declare) with new functionality and data, without requiring the original author of the type to plan or account for it.

This feature allows developers to easily build on and extend any existing application, significantly improving the composability story of Cadence.

## **Entitlements and Safe Downcasting**

In Cadence 1.0, access control has improved significantly.

Previously, Cadence’s main access-control mechanism, restricted reference types, has been a source of confusion and mistakes for contract developers. Additionally, references could not be downcast, leading to ergonomic issues.

Access control is now handled using a new feature called [Entitlements](https://cadence-lang.org/docs/language/access-control#entitlements). A reference can now be “entitled” to certain facets of an object. 

References can now always be down-casted, the standalone `auth` modifier is not necessary anymore, and got removed.

## Entitled Account Access

Previously, access to accounts was granted wholesale: Users would sign a transaction, authorizing the code of the transaction to perform any kind of operation, for example, write to storage, but also add keys or contracts.

Users had to trust that a transaction would only perform supposed access, e.g. storage access to withdraw tokens, but still had to grant full access, which would allow the transaction to perform other operations.

Dapp developers who require users to sign transactions are now able to request the minimum amount of access to perform the intended operation, i.e. developers are able to follow the principle of least privilege (PoLA).

With the introduction of entitlements, this access is now expressed using entitlements and references.

Access to administrative account operations, such as writing to storage, adding keys, or adding contracts, is now gated by both coarse grained entitlements (e.g. `Storage`, which grants access to all storage related functions, and `Keys`, which grants access to all key management functions), as well as fine-grained entitlements (e.g. `SaveValue` to save a value to storage, or `AddKey` to add a new key to the account).

Transactions can now request the particular entitlements necessary to perform the operations in the transaction.

## View Functions

View functions allow developers to improve the reliability and safety of their programs, and helps them to reason about the effects of their and the programs of others.

Developers can mark their functions as `view`, which disallows the function from performing state changes. That also makes the intent of functions clear to other programmers, as it allows them to distinguish between functions that change state and ones that do not.

## **Interface Inheritance**

Previously, interfaces could not inherit from other interfaces, which required developers to repeat code. Interface inheritance allows code abstraction and code reuse.

Interfaces can now inherit from other interfaces of the same kind. This makes it easier for developers to structure their conformances and reduces a lot of redundant code.

## **Capability Controllers**

Cadence encourages a capability-based security model. Capabilities are themselves a new concept that most Cadence programmers need to understand.

The existing linking-based capability API has been replaced by a more powerful and easier to use API based on the notion of Capability Controllers. The new API makes the creation of new and the revocation of existing capabilities simpler.

## **External Mutation Safety**

External Mutation Safety prevents a common safety foot-gun, unintentionally granting mutable access to nested data.

The mutability of containers (updating a field of a composite value, key of a map, or index of an array) through references has changed: When a field/element is accessed through a reference, a reference to the accessed inner object is returned, instead of the actual object. These returned references are unauthorized by default, and the author of the object (struct/resource/etc.) can control what operations are permitted on these returned references by using entitlements and entitlement mappings.

## **Event Definition And Emission In Interfaces**

Contract interfaces may now define event types, and these events can be emitted from function conditions and default implementations in those contract interfaces.

## **Force Destruction of Resources**

All resources are now guaranteed to be destroyable. 

It was previously possible to panic in the body of a resource or attachment’s `destroy` method, effectively preventing the destruction or removal of that resource from an account. This could be used as an attack vector by handing people undesirable resources or hydrating resources to make them extremely large or otherwise contain undesirable content.

Contracts may no longer define `destroy` functions on their resources, and are no longer required to explicitly handle the destruction of resource fields. These will instead be implicitly 
destroyed whenever a resource is destroyed.

Additionally, developers may define a `ResourceDestroyed` event which will be emitted whenever a resource of that type is destroyed.

## Inlined and Deduplicated Storage

Cadence uses the [Atree](https://github.com/onflow/atree) library for storing objects. Cadence 1.0 integrates Atree v0.8.0, which inlines and deduplicates stored data, which significantly reduces the amount of data stored and memory need. On Flow Testnet, this reduced memory usage by ~1/2 without sacrificing speed.

# ⚡ Breaking Improvements

Many of the improvements of Cadence 1.0 fundamentally change how Cadence works and how it is used. That also means it was necessary to break existing code to release this version, which guarantees stability (no more planned breaking changes) going forward.

As breaking changes are simply no longer acceptable after Cadence 1.0, we used this last chance to fix and improve Cadence, ensuring it delivers on its promise of being a language that provides security and safety, while also enabling composability and simplicity.

 We appreciate that updating existing code can be challenging for developers. However, we believe these improvements are worthwhile, as they make Cadence development significantly more powerful and efficient, enabling developers to write and deploy immutable contracts.

The improvements were intentionally bundled into one release to avoid breaking Cadence programs multiple times.

## **References to Resource-Kinded Values Get Invalidated When the Referenced Values Are Moved**

References are now invalidated if the referenced resource is moved after the reference was taken. The reference is invalidated upon the first move, regardless of the origin and the destination.

Previously, when a reference is taken to a resource, that reference remains valid even if the resource was moved, for example when created and moved into an account, or moved from one account into another.

In other words, references to resources stayed alive forever. This could be a potential safety foot-gun, where one could gain/give/retain unintended access to resources through references.

## **Conditions No Longer Allow State Changes**

In the current version of Cadence, pre-conditions and post-conditions may perform state changes, e.g. by calling a function that performs a mutation. This may result in unexpected behavior, which might lead to bugs.

To make conditions predictable, they are no longer allowed to perform state changes.

Pre-conditions and post-conditions are now considered `view` contexts, meaning that any operations that would be prevented inside of a `view` function are also not permitted in a pre-condition or post-condition.

This is to prevent underhanded code wherein a user modifies global or contract state inside of a condition, where they are meant to simply be asserting properties of that state.

## **Semantics for Variables in For-Loop Statements Got Improved**

The behavior of `for-in` loops improved, so that a new iteration variable is introduced for each iteration.

Previously, the iteration variable of `for-in` loops was re-assigned on each iteration.

Even though this is a common behavior in many programming languages, it is surprising behavior and a source of bugs.

The behavior was improved to the often assumed/expected behavior of a new iteration variable being introduced for each iteration, which reduces the likelihood for a bug.

## **Restricted Types Got Replaced with Intersection Types**

With the improvements to access control enabled by entitlements and safe down-casting, the restricted type feature is redundant.

Restricted types have been removed. All types, including references, can now be down-casted, restricted types are no longer used for access control. At the same time intersection types got introduced.

## Definite Return Analysis Got Improved

The definite return analysis got significantly improved.

Definite return analysis determines if a function always exits, in all possible execution paths, e.g. through a `return` statement, or by calling a function that never returns, like `panic`.

This analysis was incomplete and required developers to add workarounds to their code.

## **Syntax for Function Types Improved**

Previously, function types were expressed using a different syntax from function declarations or expressions. The previous syntax was unintuitive for developers, making it hard to write and read code that used function types.

Function types are now expressed using the `fun` keyword, just like expressions and declarations. This improves readability and makes function types more obvious.

## **`pub` and `priv` Access Modifiers Got Removed**

The `pub`, `priv` and `pub(set)` access modifiers got removed from the language, in favor of their more explicit `access(all)` and `access(self)` equivalents (for `pub` and `priv`, respectively).

This makes access modifiers more uniform and better match the new entitlements syntax.

## **Naming Rules Got Tightened**

Previously, Cadence allowed language keywords (e.g. `continue`, `for`, etc.) to be used as names. This had the potential to confuse developers or readers of programs, and could potentially lead to bugs.

Most language keywords are no longer allowed to be used as names. Some keywords are still allowed to be used as names, as they have limited significance within the language.

## **Nested Type Requirements Got Removed**

Nested Type Requirements were a fairly advanced concept of the language. The feature was uncommon in other programming languages and hard to understand.

Just like an interface could require a conforming type to provide a certain field or function, it could also have required the conforming type to provide a nested type.

## **Deprecated Key Management API Got Removed**

Cadence provided two key management APIs:

- The original, low-level API, which worked with RLP-encoded keys
- The improved, high-level API, which works with convenient data types like `PublicKey`, `HashAlgorithm`, and `SignatureAlgorithm`

The original account key management API, got removed. The improved API was introduced, as the original API was difficult to use and error-prone. The original API was deprecated in early 2022.

## **Result of `toBigEndianBytes()` for `U?Int(128|256)` Fixed**

Previously, the implementation of `.toBigEndianBytes()` was incorrect for the large integer types `Int128`, `Int256`, `UInt128`, and `UInt256`. This had the potential to confuse developers or readers of programs, and could potentially lead to bugs.

The result for `toBigEndianBytes()` on ****`Int128` and `UInt128` is now always an array of 16 bytes, and for `Int256` and `UInt256` 32 bytes.

# 🐞 Bugfixes

## **Resource Tracking for Optional Bindings Improved**

Resource tracking for optional bindings (”if-let statements”) was fixed.

Previously, resource tracking for optional bindings was implemented incorrectly, leading to errors for valid code. This required developers to add workarounds to their code.

## Missing or Incorrect Argument Labels Get Reported

Function calls with missing argument labels and function calls with incorrect argument labels are now reported properly.

Previously, missing or incorrect argument labels of function calls were not reported.

This had the potential to confuse developers or readers of programs, and could potentially lead to bugs.

## **Incorrect Operators in Reference Expressions Get Reported**

Previously, incorrect operators in reference expressions were not reported.

This had the potential to confuse developers or readers of programs, and could potentially lead to bugs.

## What's Changed

### ⭐ Features

### Capability Controllers

[FLIP 798: Capability controllers](https://github.com/onflow/flips/blob/main/cadence/20220203-capability-controllers.md) got implemented.

You can start migrating existing uses of the linking-based capability API to the new Capability Controller API. The linking-based capability API is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

# [Language Server v0.26.0 (languageserver/v0.26.0)](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/releases/tag/languageserver/v0.26.0) - 2022-08-12

## 🛠 Improvements
This release introduces general improvements to the Language server code base that can be categorized into:
- **Isolating Flow client**
The Flow client was extracted and exposed via an interface, that allows us to mock it out during testing and to encapsulate all the flow client logic. 
- **Simplifying the state management**
There was a couple of complexities removed from the LS, most notably how accounts are managed, previously the accounts were managed on network, using the contract to resolve names to addresses, which provided another state that was required to be synced between LS, client and blockchain. This was removed and encapsulated within the Flow client implementation and it only contains a simple list of accounts which can be listed to the client via API if needed (clearly marking currently active account) and also can be easily switched between active accounts. No setup is required.
- **Better error handling**
Commands were refactored in how they handle errors, previously each command had to handle the error and send the response to the client, now the errors are returned from the command layer to the server where the response is handled in once place:
- **Testing**
The unit test of each of the integration components were added as well as end-to-end tests testing all the commands.

# [v0.24 (Secure Cadence) (v0.24.0)](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/releases/tag/v0.24.0) - 2022-06-07

## What's Changed

The Secure Cadence milestone is focused on code-hardening and will enable the permissionless deployment of smart contracts on Mainnet. It is an important step in [our path to Stable Cadence](https://forum.onflow.org/t/the-path-to-stable-cadence/2702).

This required some breaking changes. You can read all about these changes and how to update your contracts in this forum post:

# [v0.23.0](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/releases/tag/v0.23.0) - 2022-03-03

## 💥 Breaking Changes

* Remove `PublicKey.isValid` by [@robert-e-davidson3](https://github.com/robert-e-davidson3) in [#1273](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/1273), [#1454](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/1454)

  The `PublicKey` constructor now validates the public key data and aborts the program if it is invalid. 
  The `isValid` field was removed.

## ⭐ Features

* Add converter functions to produce path values from strings by [@dsainati1](https://github.com/dsainati1) in [#1437](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/1437), [#1211](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/1211)

  Paths can now be constructed at run-time. The following path constructors were added:

  ```kotlin
  fun PublicPath(identifier: string): PublicPath?
  fun PrivatePath(identifier: string): PrivatePath?
  fun StoragePath(identifier: string): StoragePath?
  ```

  Each of these functions take an identifier and produce a path of the appropriate domain.
  For example, to construct a public path from a string:
  
  ```kotlin
  let pathID = "foo"
  let path = PublicPath(identifier: pathID) // is /public/foo
  ```

  For more information, see https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/language/accounts/#path-functions

* Add RLP decoding utility methods by [@ramtinms](https://github.com/ramtinms) in [#1397](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/1397), [#1456](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/1456)

  Cadence now provides RLP decoding functions through the built-in contract `RLP`.
  It provides the following functions for decoding strings and lists:

  ```kotlin
  fun decodeString(_ input: [UInt8]): [UInt8]
  fun decodeList(_ input: [UInt8]): [[UInt8]]
  ```

  For more information, see https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/language/built-in-functions/#rlp

* Add index to for loop by [@dsainati1](https://github.com/dsainati1) in [#1216](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/1216), [#1452](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/1452)

  For-loops may now declare an indexing variable:

  ```kotlin
  for index, element in array {
      // ...
  }
  ```

* Add BLS-specific crypto functions by [@dsainati1](https://github.com/dsainati1) in [#1236](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/1236), [#1250](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/1250), [#1430](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/1430)

  `PublicKey` gained a new function to verify a proof-of-possession:
  
  ```kotlin
  fun verifyPoP(_ proof: [UInt8]): Bool
  ```

  Cadence now provides BLS-specific functions through the built-in contract `BLS`. 
  It provides the following functions:

  ```kotlin
  fun aggregateSignatures(_ signatures: [[UInt8]]): [UInt8]?
  fun aggregatePublicKeys(_ publicKeys: [PublicKey]): PublicKey?
  ```

  For more information, see https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/language/crypto/#bls

# [v0.20.0](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/releases/tag/v0.20.0) - 2021-11-17

This release culminates a half-year effort to improve the Cadence storage layer, i.e. how Cadence values are stored in accounts, in particular arrays, dictionaries, and composite values. [@fxamacker](https://github.com/fxamacker) and [@ramtinms](https://github.com/ramtinms) designed and implemented completely new array and ordered map data structures, resulting in [atree](https://github.com/onflow/atree). These data structures are fast and scalable: they allow efficient access and allow efficient modifications to arrays and dictionaries with very large number of elements. [@turbolent](https://github.com/turbolent) and [@SupunS](https://github.com/SupunS) integrated this new library into Cadence. This new storage layer also fixed a bug in the resource `owner` field. Please see the breaking changes section for more details.

In addition, this release saw several feature and documentation contributions by new community members. Thank you!

## 💥 Breaking Changes

- With the storage layer update, the `owner` field of resources is now implemented correctly, as originally designed:
  The field is only non-`nil` if the resource is currently in storage, and is always `nil` if the resource is on the stack.
  This breaking change is actually a bug fix, as the `owner` field was previously implemented incorrectly: After a resource was moved out of storage onto the stack, the `owner` field was still referring to the account the resource was stored in.

  Please ensure your Cadence programs do not rely on the broken behaviour and update them if needed.

  For example, in a function that is passed a resource as an argument, the resource's `owner` field will always be `nil`:

  ```kotlin
  pub fun deposit(token: @NonFungibleToken.NFT) {
      // token.owner is always nil!
      // ...
  }
  ```

- Add limit on call stack depth ([#1138](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/1138)) [@SupunS](https://github.com/SupunS)

# [v0.16.0](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/releases/tag/v0.16.0) - 2021-05-18


## 💥 Breaking Changes

- Add new crypto features ([#852](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/852)) [@SupunS](https://github.com/SupunS)

  Renamed the `ECDSA_Secp256k1` signature algorithm to `ECDSA_secp256k1`.

  Please update existing contracts, transactions, and scripts to use the new name.

- Remove the high-level storage API ([#877](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/877)) [@turbolent](https://github.com/turbolent)

  The internal interface's `SetCadenceValue` function was removed.

  This change does not affect Cadence programs (contracts, transactions, scripts).

## ⭐ Features

- Add non-local type inference for expressions ([#875](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/875)) [@SupunS](https://github.com/SupunS)

  The type of most declarations and expressions is now inferred in a uni-directional way, instead of only locally.

  For example, this allows the following declarations to type-check without having to add static casts:

  ```kotlin
  let numbers: [Int8] = [1, 2, 3]
  let nestedNumbers: [[Int8]] = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
  let numberNames: {Int64: String} = {0: "zero", 1: "one"}
  let sum: Int8 = 1 + 2
  ```

- Add new crypto features ([#852](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/852)) [@SupunS](https://github.com/SupunS)

  **Hash Algorithms**

  - Added [KMAC128_BLS_BLS12_381 hashing algorithm](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/language/crypto/#hashing-algorithms)): `HashAlgorithm.KMAC128_BLS_BLS12_381`

  **Signature Algorithms**

  - Added [BLS_BLS12_381 signature algorithm](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/language/crypto/#signature-algorithms): `SignatureAlgorithm.BLS_BLS12_381`

  **`PublicKey` Type**

  - Added the field `let isValid: Bool`. For example:

    ```kotlin
    let publicKey = PublicKey(publicKey: [], signatureAlgorithm: SignatureAlgorithm.ECDSA_P256)

    let valid = publicKey.isValid
    ```

  - Added the function `verify`, which allows validating signatures:

    ```kotlin
    pub fun verify(
        signature: [UInt8],
        signedData: [UInt8],
        domainSeparationTag: String,
        hashAlgorithm: HashAlgorithm
    ): Bool
    ```

    For example:

    ```kotlin
    let valid = publicKey.verify(
        signature: [],
        signedData: [],
        domainSeparationTag: "something",
        hashAlgorithm: HashAlgorithm.SHA2_256
    )
    ```

  - Added the function `hashWithTag`, which allows hashing with a tag:

    ```kotlin
    pub fun hashWithTag(
        _ data: [UInt8],
        tag: string,
        algorithm: HashAlgorithm
    ): [UInt8]
    ```

- Direct contract function invoke ([#878](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/878)) [@janezpodhostnik](https://github.com/janezpodhostnik)

  Cadence now supports an additional function to allow the host environment to call contract functions directly.

- Language Server: Add support for access check mode ([#868](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/868)) [@turbolent](https://github.com/turbolent)
- Record variable declaration ranges ([#880](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/880)) [@turbolent](https://github.com/turbolent)

# [v0.14.0](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/releases/tag/v0.14.0) - 2021-03-15

This release introduced a new [high-level Account Key API](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/language/accounts/) and improves the interpreter performance.
The current low-level Account Key API is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please switch to the new one.

The following example transaction demonstrates the functionality:

```kotlin
transaction {
	prepare(signer: AuthAccount) {
		let newPublicKey = PublicKey(
			publicKey: "010203".decodeHex(),
			signatureAlgorithm: SignatureAlgorithm.ECDSA_P256
		)

		// Add a key
		let addedKey = signer.keys.add(
			publicKey: newPublicKey,
			hashAlgorithm: HashAlgorithm.SHA3_256,
			weight: 100.0
		)


		// Retrieve a key
		let sameKey = signer.keys.get(keyIndex: addedKey.keyIndex)


		// Revoke a key
		signer.keys.revoke(keyIndex: addedKey.keyIndex)
	}
}
```

## ⭐ Features

- Introduce a new [high-level Account Key API](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/language/accounts/) ([#633](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/633)) [@SupunS](https://github.com/SupunS)
- Allow the Language Server to be debugged ([#663](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/663)) [@turbolent](https://github.com/turbolent)

## 💥 Breaking Changes

The `Crypto` contract has changed in a backwards-incompatible way, so the types and values it declared could be used in the new Account Key API:

- The struct `Crypto.PublicKey` was replaced by the new built-in global struct `PublicKey`. 
  There is no need anymore to import the `Crypto` contract to work with public keys.

- The struct `Crypto.SignatureAlgorithm` was replaced with the new built-in global enum `SignatureAlgorithm`.
  There is no need anymore to import the `Crypto` contract to work with signature algorithms.

- The struct `Crypto.HashAlgorithm` was replaced with the new built-in global enum `HashAlgorithm`.
  There is no need anymore to import the `Crypto` contract to work with hash algorithms.

- The signature algorithm value `Crypto.ECDSA_Secp256k1` was replaced with the new built-in enum case `SignatureAlgorithm.ECDSA_Secp256k1`

- The signature algorithm value `Crypto.ECDSA_P256` was replaced with the new built-in enum case `SignatureAlgorithm.ECDSA_P256`

- The hash algorithm `Crypto.SHA3_256` was replaced with the new built-in enum case `HashAlgorithm.SHA3_256`

- The hash algorithm `Crypto.SHA2_256` was replaced with the new built-in enum case `HashAlgorithm.SHA2_256`

## 💥 Breaking Changes

### Typed Paths ([#403](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/403))

Paths are now typed. Paths in the storage domain have type `StoragePath`, in the private domain `PrivatePath`, and in the public domain `PublicPath`.  `PrivatePath` and `PublicPath` are subtypes of `CapabilityPath`. Both `StoragePath` and `CapabilityPath` are subtypes of `Path`.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="3">Path</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">CapabilityPath</td>
    <td colspan="2" rowspan="2">StoragePath</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>PrivatePath</td>
    <td>PublicPath</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Storage API ([#403](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/403))

With paths being typed, it was possible to make the Storage API type-safer and easier to use: It is now statically checked if the correct type of path is given to a function, instead of at run-time, and therefore capability return types can now be non-optional.

The changes are as follows:

For `PublicAccount`:

- old: `fun getCapability<T>(_ path: Path): Capability<T>?` <br/>
  new: `fun getCapability<T>(_ path: PublicPath): Capability<T>`

- old: `fun getLinkTarget(_ path: Path): Path?` <br />
  new: `fun getLinkTarget(_ path: CapabilityPath): Path?`

For `AuthAccount`:

- old: `fun save<T>(_ value: T, to: Path)` <br />
  new: `fun save<T>(_ value: T, to: StoragePath)`

- old: `fun load<T>(from: Path): T?` <br />
  new: `fun load<T>(from: StoragePath): T?`

- old: `fun copy<T: AnyStruct>(from: Path): T?` <br />
  new: `fun copy<T: AnyStruct>(from: StoragePath): T?`

- old: `fun borrow<T: &Any>(from: Path): T?` <br />
  new: `fun borrow<T: &Any>(from: StoragePath): T?`

- old: `fun link<T: &Any>(_ newCapabilityPath: Path, target: Path): Capability<T>?` <br />
  new: `fun link<T: &Any>(_ newCapabilityPath: CapabilityPath, target: Path): Capability<T>?`

- old: `fun getCapability<T>(_ path: Path): Capability<T>?` <br/>
  new: `fun getCapability<T>(_ path: CapabilityPath): Capability<T>`

- old: `fun getLinkTarget(_ path: Path): Path?` <br />
  new: `fun getLinkTarget(_ path: CapabilityPath): Path?`

- old: `fun unlink(_ path: Path)` <br />
  new: `fun unlink(_ path: CapabilityPath)`

## ⭐ Features

- Add a hash function to the crypto contract ([#379](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/379))
- Added npm packages for components of Cadence. This eases the development of developer tools for Cadence:

  - `monaco-languageclient-cadence`: Language Server Protocol client for the the Monaco editor
  - `cadence-parser`: The Cadence parser

  In addition, there are also examples for the [language server](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/tree/master/npm-packages/cadence-language-server-demo) and the [parser](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/tree/master/npm-packages/cadence-parser-demo) that demonstrate the use of the packages.

- Add a command to the language server that allows getting the entry point (transaction or script) parameters ([#406](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/406))

## 🛠 Improvements

- Allow references to be returned from from scripts ([#400](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/400))
- Panic with a dedicated error for out of bounds array index ([#396](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/396))

## 📖 Documentation

- Document resource identifiers ([#394](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/394))
- Document iteration over dictionary entries ([#399](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/399))

## 📦 Dependencies

- The changes to the [CBOR library](https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor) have been [merged](https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor/pull/249), so [the `replace` statement that was necessary in the last release](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/releases/tag/v0.10.0) must be removed.

## 💥 Breaking Changes

### Contract Deployment

This release adds support for deploying multiple contracts per account.
The API for deploying has changed:

- The functions `AuthAccount.setCode` and `AuthAccount.unsafeNotInitializingSetCode` were removed ([#390](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/390)).
- A [new contract management API](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/language/contracts/#deploying-updating-and-removing-contracts) has been added, which allows adding, updating, and removing multiple contracts per account ([#333](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/333), [#352](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/352)).

  See the [updated documentation](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/language/contracts/#deploying-updating-and-removing-contracts) for details and examples.

## ⭐ Features

### Enumerations

This release adds support for enumerations ([#344](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/344)).

For example, a days-of-the-week enum can be declared though:

```swift
enum Day: UInt8 {
    case Monday
    case Tuesday
    case Wednesday
    case Thursday
    case Friday
    case Saturday
    case Sunday
}
```

See the [documentation](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/language/enumerations/) for further details and examples.

### Switch Statement

This release adds support for switch statements ([#365](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/365)).

```swift
fun describe(number: Int): String {
    switch number {
    case 1:
        return "one"
    case 2:
        return "two"
    default:
        return "other"
    }
}
```

See the [documentation](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/language/control-flow/#switch) for further details and examples.

### Code Formatter

Development of a code formatter has started, in form of a plugin for Prettier ([#348](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/348)).
If you would like to contribute, please let us know!

## 🛠 Improvements

- Limitations on data structure complexity are now enforced when decoding and also when encoding storage data, e.g number of array elements, number of dictionary entries, etc. ([#370](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/370))
- Using the force-unwrap operator on a non-optional is no longer an error, but a hint is reported suggesting the removal of the unnecessary operation ([#347](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/347))
- Language Server: The features requiring a Flow client connection are now optional. This allows using the language server in editors other than Visual Studio Code, such as Emacs, Vim, etc. ([#303](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/303))

## 🐞 Bug Fixes

- Fixed the encoding of bignums in storage ([#370](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/370))
- Fixed the timing of recording composite-type explicit-conformances ([#356](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/356))
- Added support for exporting and JSON encoding/decoding of type values and capabilities ([#374](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/374))
- Added support for exporting/importing and JSON encoding/decoding of path values ([#319](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/319))
- Fixed the handling of empty integer literals in the checker ([#354](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/354))
- Fixed the non-storable fields error ([#350](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/350))

## 📖 Documentation

- Added a [roadmap describing planned features and ideas](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) ([#367](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/367))
- Various documentation improvements ([#385](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/385)). Thanks to [@andrejtokarcik](https://github.com/andrejtokarcik) for contributing this!

## 📦 Dependencies

This release depends on a fork of the [CBOR library](github.com/fxamacker/cbor/v2) that Cadence uses.
When importing Cadence in another Go codebase, add the following statement to the `go.mod` file:

```
replace github.com/fxamacker/cbor/v2 => github.com/turbolent/cbor/v2 v2.2.1-0.20200911003300-cac23af49154

This release focuses on improvements, bug fixes, and bringing the documentation up-to-date.

## 🛠 Improvements

- Improved support on Windows: Treat carriage returns as space ([#304](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/304))
- Improved JSON marshalling for more AST elements ([#292](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/292), [#286](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/286))
- Recursively check if assignment target expression is valid, don't copy returned values ([#288](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/288))
- Consider existing prefix when suggesting completion items ([#285](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/285))
- Include available declarations in "not declared" error ([#280](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/280))
- Enforce the requirement for types to be storable in more places:
  - Transaction/script parameter types ([#305](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/305))
  - Script return type ([#291](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/291))
  - Arguments passed to the account `load` and `store` functions ([#251](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/251))

  Previously, using non-storable failed at run-time, now the programs are rejected statically.

## ⭐ Features

- Add a version constant ([#289](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/289))
- Language Server: Include error notes as related information in diagnostic ([#276](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/276))

## 🐞 Bug Fixes

- Handle incomplete types in checker ([#284](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/284))
- Fix the suggestion in the error when an interface is used as a type ([#281](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/281))

## 📖 Documentation

- Brought the documentation up-to-date, include all new language features and API changes ([#275](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/275), [#277](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/277), [#279](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/279))

## 💥 Breaking Changes

- Arguments passed to `cadence.Value#WithType` are now typed as pointers (`*cadence.Type`) rather than values (`cadence.Type`)

  Example:

  ```go
  myEventType := cadence.EventType{...})

  // this 👇 
  myEvent := cadence.NewEvent(...).WithType(myEventType)

  // changes to this 👇 
  myEvent := cadence.NewEvent(...).WithType(&myEventType)
  ```

<a id="v0.7.0"></a>
# [v0.7.0](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/releases/tag/v0.7.0) - 2020-08-05

This release contains a lot of improvements to the language server, which improve the development experience in the Visual Studio Code extension, and will also soon be integrated into the Flow Playground.

## ⭐ Features

- Added member completion to the language server ([#257](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/257))
  - Insert the argument list when completing functions ([#268](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/268))
  - Offer keyword snippets ([#268](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/268))
- Enabled running the language server in the browser by compiling it to WebAssembly ([#242](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/242))
- Added support for docstrings to the parser ([#246](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/246), [#255](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/255))
- Added support for pragmas to the parser ([#239](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/239))
- Started a source compatibility suite ([#226](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/226), [#270](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/270)).

  Cadence will be regularly checked for compatibility with existing code to ensure it does not regress in source compatibility and performance. As a start, the [Fungible Token standard](https://github.com/onflow/flow-ft) and [Non-Fungible Token standard](https://github.com/onflow/flow-ft) repositories are checked.

  Consider requesting your repository to be included in the compatibility suite!
- Added a simple minifier ([#252](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/252))

## 🛠 Improvements

- Made embedding the language server easier ([#274](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/274), [#262](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/262))
- Extended the JSON serialization for Cadence values and types ([#260](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/260), [#264](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/264), [#265](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/265), [#266](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/266), [#271](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/271), [#273](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/273)) 
- Improved conformance checking ([#245](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/245)). Made return types covariant, i.e. allow subtypes for return types of functions to satisfy interface conformance.


## 💥 Breaking Changes

- Made strings immutable ([#269](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/269))
- Moved the Visual Studio Code extension to a new repository: <https://github.com/onflow/vscode-flow> ([#244](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/244))
- Added a magic prefix to stored data ([#236](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/236)). 
  This allows versioning the data. Existing data without a prefix is migrated automatically
- Changed the order in which fields in values and types are exported to declaration order ([#272](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/272))

## 🐞 Bug Fixes

- Removed the service account from the list of usable accounts in the language server ([#261](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/261)) 
- Fixed a parsing ambiguity for return types ([#267](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/267))
- Fixed non-composite reference subtyping ([#253](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/253))

## 🧰 Maintenance

- Removed the old parser ([#249](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/249))

[Changes][v0.7.0]


<a id="v0.6.0"></a>
# [v0.6.0](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/releases/tag/v0.6.0) - 2020-07-14

This is a small release with some bug fixes, internal improvements, and one breaking change for code that embeds Cadence. 

## 💥 Breaking Changes

- Removed the unused `controller` parameter from the storage interface methods:

  - `func GetValue(owner, controller, key []byte) (value []byte, err error)` 
    → `func GetValue(owner, key []byte) (value []byte, err error)`

  - `SetValue(owner, controller, key, value []byte) (err error)`
    → `SetValue(owner, key, value []byte) (err error)`

  - `ValueExists(owner, controller, key []byte) (exists bool, err error)`
    → `ValueExists(owner, key []byte) (exists bool, err error)`

  This is only a breaking change in the implementation of Cadence, i.e for code that embeds Cadence, not in the Cadence language, i.e. for users of Cadence.

## ⭐ Features

- Added an optional callback for writes with high-level values to the interface:

  ```go
  type HighLevelStorage interface {

	  // HighLevelStorageEnabled should return true
	  // if the functions of HighLevelStorage should be called,
	  // e.g. SetCadenceValue
	  HighLevelStorageEnabled() bool

	  // SetCadenceValue sets a value for the given key in the storage, owned by the given account.
	  SetCadenceValue(owner Address, key string, value cadence.Value) (err error)
  }
  ```

  This is a feature in the implementation of Cadence, i.e for code that embeds Cadence, not in the Cadence language, i.e. for users of Cadence.

## 🛠 Improvements

- Don't report an error for a restriction with an invalid type
- Record the occurrences of types. This enables the "Go to definition" feature for types in the language server
- Parse member expressions without a name. This allows the checker to run. This will enable adding code completion support or members in the future.

## 🐞 Bug Fixes

- Fixed a crash when checking the invocation of a function on an undeclared variable
- Fixed handling of functions in composite values in the JSON-CDC encoding
- Fixed a potential stack overflow when checking member storability

## ⭐ Features and Improvements

### Crypto

A new built-in contract `Crypto` was added for performing cryptographic operations.

The contract can be imported using `import Crypto`.

This first iteration provides support for validating signatures, with an API that supports multiple signatures and weighted keys.

For example, to verify two signatures with equal weights for some signed data:

```swift
let keyList = Crypto.KeyList()

let publicKeyA = Crypto.PublicKey(
    publicKey:
        "db04940e18ec414664ccfd31d5d2d4ece3985acb8cb17a2025b2f1673427267968e52e2bbf3599059649d4b2cce98fdb8a3048e68abf5abe3e710129e90696ca".decodeHex(),
    signatureAlgorithm: Crypto.ECDSA_P256
)
keyList.add(
    publicKeyA,
    hashAlgorithm: Crypto.SHA3_256,
    weight: 0.5
)

let publicKeyB = Crypto.PublicKey(
    publicKey:
        "df9609ee588dd4a6f7789df8d56f03f545d4516f0c99b200d73b9a3afafc14de5d21a4fc7a2a2015719dc95c9e756cfa44f2a445151aaf42479e7120d83df956".decodeHex(),
    signatureAlgorithm: Crypto.ECDSA_P256
)
keyList.add(
    publicKeyB,
    hashAlgorithm: Crypto.SHA3_256,
    weight: 0.5
)

let signatureSet = [
    Crypto.KeyListSignature(
        keyIndex: 0,
        signature:
            "8870a8cbe6f44932ba59e0d15a706214cc4ad2538deb12c0cf718d86f32c47765462a92ce2da15d4a29eb4e2b6fa05d08c7db5d5b2a2cd8c2cb98ded73da31f6".decodeHex()
    ),
    Crypto.KeyListSignature(
        keyIndex: 1,
        signature:
            "bbdc5591c3f937a730d4f6c0a6fde61a0a6ceaa531ccb367c3559335ab9734f4f2b9da8adbe371f1f7da913b5a3fdd96a871e04f078928ca89a83d841c72fadf".decodeHex()
    )
]

// "foo", encoded as UTF-8, in hex representation
let signedData = "666f6f".decodeHex()

let isValid = keyList.isValid(
    signatureSet: signatureSet,
    signedData: signedData
)
```

### Run-time Types

The type `Type` was added to represent types at run-time.

To create a type value, use the constructor function `Type<T>()`, which accepts the static type as a type argument.

This is similar to e.g. `T.self` in Swift, `T::class` in Kotlin, and `T.class` in Java.

For example, to represent the type `Int` at run-time:

```swift
let intType: Type = Type<Int>()
```

This works for both built-in and user-defined types. For example, to get the type value for a resource:

```swift
resource Collectible {}

let collectibleType = Type<@Collectible>()
```

The function `fun isInstance(_ type: Type): Bool` can be used to check if a value has a certain type:

```swift
let collectible <- create Collectible()
let collectibleType = Type<@Collectible>()
let result = collectible.isInstance(collectibleType)
```

For example, this allows implementing a marketplace sale resource:

```swift
pub resource SimpleSale {

    pub var objectForSale: @AnyResource?
    pub let priceForObject: UFix64
    pub let requiredCurrency: Type
    pub let paymentReceiver: Capability<&{FungibleToken.Receiver}>

    init(
        objectForSale: @AnyResource,
        priceForObject: UFix64,
        requiredCurrency: Type,
        paymentReceiver: Capability<&{FungibleToken.Receiver}>
    ) {
        self.objectForSale <- objectForSale
        self.priceForObject = priceForObject
        self.requiredCurrency = requiredCurrency
        self.paymentReceiver = paymentReceiver
    }

    destroy() {
        destroy self.objectForSale
    }

    pub fun buyObject(purchaseAmount: @FungibleToken.Vault): @AnyResource {
        pre {
            self.objectForSale != nil
            purchaseAmount.balance >= self.priceForObject
            purchaseAmount.isInstance(self.requiredCurrency)
        }

        let receiver = self.paymentReceiver.borrow()
            ?? panic("failed to borrow payment receiver capability")

        receiver.deposit(from: <-purchaseAmount)
        let objectForSale <- self.objectForSale <- nil
        return <-objectForSale
    }
}
```

### New Parser

The existing parser was replaced by a new implementation, completely written from scratch, producing the same result as the old parser.

It is significantly faster than the old parser. For example, the following benchmark shows the difference for parsing all fungible and non-fungible token contracts and example transactions:

```sh
$ go run ./cmd/parse -bench ../../flow-{n,}ft/{contracts,transactions}/*

The new parser also provides better error messages and will allow us to provide even better error messages in the future.

The new parser is enabled by default – if you discover any problems or regressions, please report them!

### Typed Capabilities

Capabilities now accept an optional type argument, the reference type the capability should be borrowed as.

If a type argument is provided, it will be used for `borrow` and `check` calls, so there is no need to provide a type argument for the calls anymore.

The function `getCapability` now also accepts an optional type argument, and returns a typed capability if one is provided.

For example, the following two functions have the same behaviour:

```swift
fun cap1(): &Something? {
  // The type annotation for `cap` is only added for demonstration purposes,
  // it can also be omitted, because it can be inferred from the value
  let cap: Capability = getAccount(0x1).getCapability(/public/something)!
  return cap.borrow<&Something>()
}

fun cap2(): &Something? {
  // The type annotation for `cap` is only added for demonstration purposes,
  // it can also be omitted, because it can be inferred from the value
  let cap: Capability<&Something> =
      getAccount(0x1).getCapability<&Something>(/public/something)!
  return cap.borrow()
}
```

Prefer a typed capability over a non-typed one to reduce uses / borrows to a simple `.borrow()`, instead of having to repeatedly mention the borrowed type.

### Parameters for Scripts

Just like transactions, the `main` functions of scripts can now have parameters.

For example, a script that can be passed an integer and a string, and which logs both values, can be written as:

```swift
pub fun main(x: Int, y: String) {
    log(x)
    log(y)
}
```

### Standard Library

The function `fun toString(): String` was added to all number types and addresses. It returns the textual representation of the type. A future version of Cadence will add this function to more types.

The function `fun toBytes(): [UInt8]` was added to `Address`. It returns the byte representation of the address.

The function `fun toBigEndianBytes(): [UInt8]` was added to all number types. It returns the big-endian byte representation of the number value.

## 🐞 Bug Fixes

- Fixed the checking of return statements:
  A missing return value is now properly reported
- Fixed the checking of function invocations:
  Resources are temporarily moved into the invoked function
- Disabled caching of top-level programs (transactions, scripts)
- Fixed the comparison of optional values
- Fixed parsing of unpadded fixed point numbers
  in the JSON encoding of Cadence values (JSON-CDC)

## 💥 Breaking Changes

### Field Types

Fields which have a non-storable type are now rejected:

Non-storable types are:

- Functions (e.g. `((Int): Bool)`)
- Accounts (`AuthAccount` / `PublicAccount`)
- Transactions
- `Void`

A future version will also make references non-storable. Instead of storing a reference, store a capability and borrow it to acquire a reference.
### Byte Arrays

Cadence now represents all byte arrays as `[UInt8]` rather than `[Int]`. This affects the following functions:

- `String.decodeHex(): [Int]` => `String.decodeHex(): [UInt8]`
- `AuthAccount.addPublicKey(publicKey: [Int])` => `AuthAccount.addPublicKey(publicKey: [UInt8])`
- `AuthAccount.setCode(code: [Int])` => `AuthAccount.setCode(code: [UInt8])`

However, array literals such as the following will still be inferred as `[Int]`, meaning that they can't be used directly:

```swift
myAccount.addPublicKey([1, 2, 3])
```

Consider using `String.decodeHex()` for now until type inference has been improved.


[Changes][v0.5.0]


<a id="v0.4.0"></a>
# [v0.4.0](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/releases/tag/v0.4.0) - 2020-06-02

## 💥 Breaking Changes

- The `AuthAccount` constructor now requires a `payer` parameter, from which the account creation fee is deducted. The `publicKeys` and `code` parameters were removed.

## ⭐ Features

- Added the function `unsafeNotInitializingSetCode` to `AuthAccount` which, like `setCode`, updates the account's code but does not create a new contract object or invoke its initializer. This function can be used to upgrade account code without overwriting the existing stored contract object.

  ⚠️ This is potentially unsafe because no data migration is performed. For example, changing a field's type results in undefined behaviour (i.e. could lead to the execution being aborted).

## 🐞 Bug Fixes

- Fixed variable shadowing for-in identifier to shadow outer scope ([#72](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/72))
- Fixed order of declaring conformances and usages
- Fixed detection of resource losses in invocation of optional chaining result


[Changes][v0.4.0]


<a id="v0.3.0"></a>
# [v0.3.0](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/releases/tag/v0.3.0) - 2020-05-26

## 💥 Breaking Changes

- Dictionary values which are resources are now stored in separate storage keys. This is transparent to programs, so is not breaking on a program level, but on the integration level.
- The state encoding was switched from Gob to CBOR. This is transparent to programs, so is not breaking on a program level, but on the integration level.
- The size of account addresses was reduced from 160 bits to 64 bits 

## ⭐ Features

- Added bitwise operations
- Added support for caching of program ASTs
- Added metrics
- Block info can be queried now

## 🛠 Improvements

- Unnecessary writes are now avoided by tracking modifications
- Improved access modifier checks
- Improved the REPL
- Decode and validate transaction arguments
- Work on a new parser has started and is almost complete

## 🐞 Bug Fixes

- Fixed account code updated 
- Fixed the destruction of arrays
- Fixed type requirements
- Implemented modulo for `[U]Fix64`, fix modulo with negative operands
- Implemented division for `[U]Fix64`
- Fixed the `flow.AccountCodeUpdated` event
- Fixed number conversion
- Fixed function return checking
