# Temporarily disabled, due to it not being useful
# The reason it wasn't being useful is that flow-go master and cadence master are not usually connected.
# both repositories use feature branches for deploy versions
# 
# With modifications this could still be useful in the future


# Open a PR in flow-go when a PR in cadence is merged
# The PR in flow-go is based on the last opened `auto-cadence-upgrade/*` if it exists.
# Otherwise, it's based on the feature/secure-cadence branch.
