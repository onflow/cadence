// It is useful for use with atree's PersistentSlabStorage.FixLoadedBrokenReferences.
//
// NOTE: The intended use case is to enable migration programs in onflow/flow-go to fix broken references.
// As of April 2024, only 10 registers in testnet (not mainnet) were found to have broken references,
// and they seem to have resulted from a bug that was fixed 2 years ago by https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/1565.
