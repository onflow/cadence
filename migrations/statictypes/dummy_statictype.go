// This is only for testing the migration, so that a type-value with a deprecated primitive type
// (e.g: `PrimitiveStaticTypePublicAccount`) is insertable as a dictionary key (to populate the storage).
// i.e: To make hashing function works, which requires `ID()` method.
// Currently, this is not possible, since the `ID` function of `interpreter.PrimitiveStaticType`
// of deprecated types no longer work, as it relies on the `sema.Type`,
// but the corresponding `sema.Type` for the deprecated primitive types are no longer available.
