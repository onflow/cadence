# The Flow Fungible Token standard

## `FungibleToken` contract

If a users wants to deploy a new token contract, their contract
needs to implement the FungibleToken interface and their tokens
need to implement the interfaces defined in this contract.

## `Vault` resource interface

Each fungible token resource type needs to implement the `Vault` resource interface.

## `Provider`, `Receiver`, and `Balance` resource interfaces

These interfaces declare pre-conditions and post-conditions that restrict
the execution of the functions in the Vault.

It gives users the ability to make custom resources that implement
these interfaces to do various things with the tokens.
For example, a faucet can be implemented by conforming
to the Provider interface.
