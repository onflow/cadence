# Update Tool

The update tool helps with updating Flow downstream dependencies to a new Cadence version.
It is able to automate tedious tasks like bumping versions, opening PRs, tagging, etc.
The tool automatically detects versions and supports multiple modules per repo.


## Usage

### Install Dependencies

```sh
npm i -g typescript ts-node
```

### Run

```sh
GH_TOKEN=<github_token> ts-node main.ts update --version <version>
```

If the github CLI (`gh`) is installed and configured, the auth token can also be retrieved from the github CLI,
instead of manually providing.

```sh
GH_TOKEN=`gh auth token` ts-node main.ts update --version <version>
```

The `update` command use HTTPS to connect to github by default. To use SSH instead, use `--useSSH true` as arguments in
the command.

By default, the tool does not release certain dependencies. e.g. flow-go.
These repos have to be manually released/tagged.

#### Using existing versions

Suppose there are already released versions of certain downstream dependencies.
For example suppose we want to update downstream dependencies to Cadence `v0.30.0`,
and the `flow-go-sdk` is already updated with that Cadence version and is already tagged as `v0.31.0`.
Similarly, suppose `flow-go` is also already updated with that Cadence version and is already tagged as `v0.26.0`.

Then, updating the remaining of downstream dependencies can be done by providing the already released versions manually
to the update command. The `--versions` flag would take a comma separated set of repos.

```sh
GH_TOKEN=<github_token> ts-node main.ts update --version v0.30.0 --versions onflow/flow-go-sdk@v0.31.0,onflow/flow-go@v0.26.0
```

Above will update the rest of the dependencies to:
- Cadence `v0.30.0`
- flow-go-sdk `v0.31.0`
- flow-go `v0.26.0`

Instead of the version, it is also possible to provide a commit id.

```sh
GH_TOKEN=`gh auth token` ts-node main.ts update --version v0.30.0 --versions onflow/flow-go@<commit_id>
```

#### Configuring dependencies

Dependencies are configured in `config.yaml`.

### Process

The update process is basically a cycle of the following steps for each downstream dependency:

1. Use the tool to open a PR that updates the dependencies
2. Review the PR for correctness
3. Get the PR reviewed, approved, and merged
3. Release a new version of the downstream dependency
4. Go to 1

### Example

Let's walk through an example scenario.

Cadence release `v1.0.0-M8` was just published.

#### Updating the first downstream dependency

Start the process of updating all downstream dependencies by invoking the `update` subcommand with the new Cadence version.

The Cadence version needs to be provided using the `--version` flag.

```shell
$ GH_TOKEN=`gh auth token` ts-node main.ts update \
    --version v1.0.0-M8
```

The command will determine that the `flow-go-sdk` downstream dependency is outdated and will propose to open a PR for it.

Agree to have a PR opened, get it reviewed, approved, and merged.

Check the GitHub releases page and determine the next version, e.g. for `flow-go-sdk`, https://github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk/releases.

In this example, the next version is `v1.0.0-M5`.

Use the `release` subcommand to create a new tag:

```shell
$ GH_TOKEN=`gh auth token` ts-node main.ts release --repo onflow/flow-go-sdk --version v1.0.0-M5
```

```
</details>

Go to the link that is shown at the end to create a new GitHub (pre-)release for this dependency, e.g. https://github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk/releases/new?tag=v1.0.0-M5.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Cadence 1.0 is not released yet, so all releases MUST be PRE-RELEASES!

#### Updating the next downstream dependency

Once the GitHub release has been published, re-run the `update` subcommand. The tool will determine that the next dependency needs to be updated.

> [!NOTE]
> The update tool only considers proper releases (i.e. not pre-releases)! (this is a GitHub API limitation)
>
> When updating to pre-releases, the version of a downstream has to be specified manually! This is not needed normally.

Versions are specified using the `--versions` flag, comma-separated.

```shell
GH_TOKEN=`gh auth token` ts-node main.ts update \
    --version v1.0.0-M8 \
    --versions onflow/flow-go-sdk@v1.0.0-M5
```

Again, the tool will determine the next downstream dependency that needs to get updated. This time is the `lint` module in the  `onflow/cadence-tools` repo.

#### Caveats to be aware of

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For some downstream dependencies,

- Some downstream dependencies, like `flow-go`, are not tagged/released.

  Use the latest commit instead.

  For example, to `flow-emulator` depends on `flow-go`, and it can be updated using:

  ```shell
  $ GH_TOKEN=`gh auth token` ts-node main.ts update \
      --version v1.0.0-M8 \
      --versions onflow/flow-go-sdk@v1.0.0-M5,onflow/cadence-tools/lint@v1.0.0-M5,onflow/flow-go@3677206d445c
  ```

- Some downstream dependencies are modules in the same repo.

  When releasing, specify the `--mod` flag.

  For example, to release module `lint` in repo `cadence-tools`:

  ```shell
  $ GH_TOKEN=`gh auth token` ts-node main.ts release \
      -r onflow/cadence-tools \
      --mod lint \
      --version v1.0.0-M5
  ```

- Some downstream dependencies's main branch (e.g. `master`) has not been updated to Cadence 1.0 yet, and the changes for Cadence 1.0 are still on a feature branch.

  For example, the update to Cadence 1.0 in `flow-go` is in the feature branch `feature/stable-cadence`.

- `flowkit` is at `v2`, which Go handles specially, and the update tool does not quite support out-of-the-box yet.

  Specify the version both for `onflow/flowkit` and for `onflow/flowkit/v2`.

  For example, to update a downstream dependency of `flowkit` to `v2.0.0-stable-cadence-alpha.5`, use `onflow/flowkit@v2.0.0-stable-cadence-alpha.5,onflow/flowkit/v2@v2.0.0-stable-cadence-alpha.5`.

## Development

When updating the JSON Schema, regenerate the TypeScript definition:

```sh
./node_modules/json-schema-to-typescript/dist/src/cli.js config.schema.json > config.schema.ts
```
