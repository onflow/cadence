### FLIPs

#### Relax interface conformance restrictions

* FLIP: [https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/134](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/134)

* Overview:

    * Follow up on interface conformance improvements ([https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/83](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/83)).

    * Proposes to allow empty function declaration defined in one interface to coexist with a default function implementation defined in another interface.

    * Currently the same is allowed if the empty declaration has a pre/post condition.

    * When interface default functions were introduced, interface inheritance did not exist yet

    * Current behavior was intentional, tried to avoid interface author breaking implementations by adding function implementation (default function)

* Status:

    * FLIP is waiting for a final decision

    * Reference implementation is complete: [https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/2725](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/2725)

* Next steps:

    * Would like to get more feedback

    * Provide means / explanation to try out

#### Random function

* FLIP: [https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/120](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/120)

* Overview:

    * Rename unsafeRandom to random, underlying implementation has been secured using Flow protocol native random beacon

    * Update the interface to a safer and more convenient one (generalized types and a modulo parameter)

    * Rollout: add random, deprecate unsafeRandom, finally remove in SC release

* Status:

    * Positive sentiment for random

    * Renamed to revertibleRandom

* Open problems:

    * Behavior in scripts

        * Should not panic

        * Several options

    * Naming:

        * Potential for misuse by developers. Unsafe ‚Üí safe renaming might be confusing

        * Maybe addressed by commit-reveal scheme FLIP: [https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/123](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/123)

* Next steps:

    * Voted, approved üéâ

#### Commit-reveal scheme for non-reverted randomness

* FLIP: [https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/123](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/123)

* Overview:

    * Provide a safe pattern to address transaction abortion after a random is revealed

    * Commit to block

    * In the future, query history of past randoms

    * Use past, committed seed for new random

* Status:

    * Positive sentiment

    * Waiting for feedback

* Open problems:

    * Storage/sharing of state, see below

* Next steps:

    * Gather more feedback

    * Maybe have breakout session to discuss concerns

* Feedback:

    * Why stored on-chain?

        * What is the concern?

            * Should be stored in protocol state

            * Details on how data is shared/stored

            * If just implementation detail, make it explicit

        * Where else?

#### Remove custom destructors

* FLIP:  [https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/131](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/131)

* Overview:

    * Proposal to address inability for users to destroy resources they own

    * One of the discussed options (others: try/catch, etc.)

    * Originated from attachments feature (attachment might prevent destruction of whole resource)

    * Remove destroy

    * Allows users to always destroy resources

* Status:

    * Breakout session: Came up open problem

    * Synced with execution team, discussed tombstoning (marking data as deleted, "garbage collection")

    * Updated FLIP with default events

    * FLIP ready for another round of discussion

* Open problems:

    * Philosophical question (sending to "burner account")

    * Existing code / applications

    * "Migration" path for use-cases like FT total supply

    * Tombstoning implementation

* Next steps:

    * Need to discuss implementation approach more

    * Implementation is not blocking Stable Cadence release, but can vote on change itself, removal of custom destructors

        * Do not need a solution for "large resource deletion" problem

    * Breakout session next week, after giving time to read through updated proposal

* Feedback:
