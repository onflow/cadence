### FLIPs

#### 134: Relax interface conformance restrictions

* FLIP: [https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/134](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/134)

* Overview:

    * Follow up on interface conformance improvements ([https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/83](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/83)).

    * Proposes to allow empty function declaration defined in one interface to coexist with a default function implementation defined in another interface.

    * Currently the same is allowed if the empty declaration has a pre/post condition.

    * When interface default functions were introduced, interface inheritance did not exist yet

    * Current behavior was intentional, tried to avoid interface author breaking implementations by adding function implementation (default function)

* Status:

    * FLIP is waiting for a final decision

    * Reference implementation is complete: [https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/2725](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/2725)

* Next steps:

    * Would like to get more feedback

    * Provide means / explanation to try out

* Notes:

    * Accepted

#### 210: Improvement to entitlement mapping syntax

* FLIP: [https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/210](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/210)

* Overview:

    * Got some feedback that visually entitlements and entitlement mappings appear too similar when used in an `access` modifier. This can be confusing to developers because the former cannot be accessed on an unentitled reference, while the latter can be (and produces an unentitled output)

    * Proposed needing a `mapping` keyword in access modifiers: e.g. `access(mapping M)`

* Status:

    * FLIP proposed, has general approval

* Next Steps:

    * Accept FLIP, merge implementation?

* Notes:

    * Approved

#### 196: Restrict Capabilities Publish

* FLIP: [https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/197](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/197)

* Overview:

    * Current Cap Cons API allows publishing capabilities of another account

    * Was not possible with linking API

    * Could lead to confusion for developers (e.g. query balance, but balance is from another account)

* Status:

    * Ready for vote

* Next Steps:

* Notes:

    * Approved

#### 212: Reject references to references

* FLIP: [https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/212](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/212)

* Overview:

    * It is currently possible to create references to references, e.g. &&T

    * Such references are not useful

    * In Cadence 1.0, additional work is requires to keep them working

    * Proposal is to forbid them

* Status:

    * Ready for vote

* Next Steps:

* Notes:

    * Approved

#### 131: Remove custom destructors

* FLIP:  [https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/131](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/131)

* Overview:

    * Proposal to address inability for users to destroy resources they own

    * One of the discussed options (others: try/catch, etc.)

    * Originated from attachments feature (attachment might prevent destruction of whole resource)

    * Remove destroy

    * Allows users to always destroy resources

* Status:

    * Updated FLIP with default events

    * Discovered that introduction of attachments would require additional code in e.g. Vault.deposit to prevent exploit

    * FLIP ready for another round of discussion

* Open problems:

    * Philosophical question (sending to "burner account")

    * Existing code / applications

    * "Migration" path for use-cases like FT total supply

    * Tombstoning implementation

* Next steps:

    * Need to discuss implementation approach more

    * Implementation is not blocking Stable Cadence release, but can vote on change itself, removal of custom destructors

        * Do not need a solution for "large resource deletion" problem

    * Breakout session next week, after giving time to read through updated proposal

* Feedback:

    * Non-mutable contraction mainnet using custom destructor

    * Overhead creating workaround

    * Will USDC implement a workaround ?

* Notes:

    * Approved

#### 95: Entitlements migration

* FLIP: [https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/95](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/95)

* Overview:

* Status:

* Next Steps:

#### 179: Staged Contract Updates

* FLIP: [https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/179](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/179)

* Overview:

    * Contract mechanism to define contract update deployments and execute updates in stages at/beyond a block height. Execution can also be delegated to a third party via Capabilities

* Status:

    * Proposed & approved by Jerome & Josh

    * Was hoping for community approval on the FLIP before moving to approval, but only feedback provided so far

* Next Steps:

    * Approve unless recent feedback is opposed

    * Merge tryUpdate() to finalize v0 implementation & build out tests

    * Design automated update solution so delegated updates can be executed immediately post-spork

    * Begin to address callouts around:

        * Creating update configuration

        * Emulating configured updates

        * Monitoring update status

### Other

#### Discuss changes to attachments

* Overview

    * Problem:

        * Attachments are able to declare what entitlements they need, to perform operations on base

        * A *third-party* might prepare a value with an attachment. With the transfer of the value, also the attachment and thus the permissions on the base, are transferred

        * The receiver might not realize

        * Reference to base stays "alive" beyond TX/script

    * Running example:

        * Currency converter on vault, can deposit and withdraw

    * Proposal:

        * Remove support for requirement of entitlements

        * Only allow public access to begin with

        * Later: Add support for entitled access,

            *  e.g. through

            * Entitlement mapping

                * `access(M) attachment A for S {}`

                * Privilege escalation through mapping?
                  E.g. Deposit → Withdraw

                * ```cadence
                    mapping M {
                        X -> Y
                    }

                    access(Y) fun foo() {
                        // can use X on base
                    }
                    ```

                * Maybe hardcode to Identity mapping?

                    * `access(X) fun foo() { … }`

                    * no mapping

                            * Requirements on per-function level (instead of whole attachment)

                            * Do not want to require splitting attachments into parts

    * Alternative: Sanitization

        * Doesn’t scale, too easy to forget, footgun ("malicious USB stick")

* Status:

    * Decide if this / what should be proposed in a FLIP

* Next steps:

    * Propose FLIP for

        * Requirement removal

        * Propose unentitled access to start with

        * Can add entitled access later (see above)

    * Examples for proposals which allow entitlements
