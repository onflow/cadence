title: Core Events
---

# Introduction

This document describes events emitted from core contracts and FVM. 

# Querying Events

To query events you will need to connect to a Flow access node using the SDK for the language that you are using.

## Go SDK

Documentation for how to handle events can be found here:

[https://github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk#querying-events](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk#querying-events)

And sample code for doing so is here:

[https://github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk/tree/master/examples/query_events](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk/tree/master/examples/query_events)

## JavaScript SDK

You can find the JavaScript SDK for Flow here:

[https://github.com/onflow/flow-js-sdk](https://github.com/onflow/flow-js-sdk)


## Flow CLI

You can use Flow CLI to query events, learn more about it here:

[https://docs.onflow.org/flow-cli/get-events/](https://docs.onflow.org/flow-cli/get-events/)

# Event Descriptions

## Native Events
Native events are events emitted directly from the FVM (Flow virtual machine). The events have the same name on 
all networks and don't follow the standard naming.

### Account Created

Event that is emitted when a new account gets created.

Event name: `flow.AccountCreated`


```cadence
pub event AccountCreated(address: Address)
```

| Field             | Type   | Description                                                            |
| ----------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| address       | Address | The address of the newly created account |


### Account Key Added

Event that is emitted when a key gets added to an account.

| contract       | String | The name of the the contract |



## Core Contract Events

Flow relies on a set of core contracts that define key portions of the Flow protocol. Those contracts are core contracts 
and are made to emit the events documented bellow. You can read about the core [contracts here](https://docs.onflow.org/core-contracts) 
and view their source code with events definitions.

Events emitted from core contracts follow the standard format:
```
A.{contract address}.{contract name}.{event name}
```
The components of the event name:
- `contract address` - the address of the account the contract has been deployed to
- `contract name` - the name of the contract in the source code
- `event name` - the name of the event found in the source code event definition

### Flow Token Contract
Description of events emitted from the [Flow Token contract](https://docs.onflow.org/core-contracts/flow-token/). 
The contract defines the fungible Flow token. Please note that events for the fungible token contracts are the same 
if deployed to a different account but the `contract address` is 
changed to the address of the account the contract has been deployed to.
