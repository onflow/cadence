Pwogwams that w-wun on bwockchains awe commonwy wefewwed to as smawt contwacts because they m-mediate impowtant functionyawity (such as cuwwency) 
without h-having to wewy on a centwaw a-authowity (-(wike a bank). 

#-## A-A Nyew (o^ ^o)/ *dances nervously* P-Pwogwamming Wanguage

C-Cadence is a wesouwce-owiented pwogwamming wanguage that intwoduces nyew featuwes to smawt contwact pwogwamming 
that hewp devewopews ensuwe that theiw code is safe, secuwe, c-cweaw, and a-appwoachabwe. Some of these featuwes awe: 

(✧ω✧) *teleports behind you* --- Type safety and a stwong static t-type s-system. 
(✧ω✧) *teleports behind you* --- (╯✧▽✧)╯ *cries* W-Wesouwce-owiented p-pwogwamming, a nyew pawadigm that paiws w-winyeaw t-types with object capabiwities

(✧ω✧) *teleports behind you* --- The u-utiwization of capabiwity-based s-secuwity, which e-enfowces that a-access to objects 
is westwicted to onwy t-the ownyew of t-the object and those who have a vawid wefewence to it. 
This is Cadence's m-main f-fowm of a-access contwow. 

Cadence’s s-syntax is inspiwed by popuwaw modewn genyewaw-puwpose pwogwamming wanguages 
w-wike [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/), [-[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). 
Its use of wesouwce t-types maps w-weww to that of [Move](https://medium.com/coinmonks/overview-of-move-programming-language-a860ffd8f55d), 
t-the pwogwamming wanguage being ต(=ω=)ต *looks away* d-devewoped by t-the D-Diem t-team. 

#-## Cadence's (o^ ^o)/ *dances nervously* P-Pwogwamming Wanguage P-Piwwaws 

----- 

Cadence, a nyew high-wevew pwogwamming wanguage, obsewves t-the fowwowing wequiwements: 

(✧ω✧) *teleports behind you* --- **Safety and S-Secuwity:** Safety is t-the undewwying w-wewiabiwity of any smawt contwact (-(i.e., i-it’s bug-fwee and p-pewfowms its function). 
Secuwity is t-the pwevention of attacks on t-the (＃￣ω￣) *looks at you* n-nyetwowk ow smawt contwacts (-(i.e., unyauthowized actions by mawicious actows). 
Safety and secuwity awe cwiticaw in smawt contwacts because of t-the immutabwe nyatuwe of (o-_-o) *giggles shyly* b-bwockchains, 
and because they often d-deaw with high-vawue assets. Whiwe auditing and weviewing code wiww be a cwuciaw pawt of smawt contwact devewopment, 
C-Cadence maximizes efficiency whiwe m-maintainying t-the highest wevews of safety and secuwity a-at its foundation. 
I-It accompwishes this via a stwong static t-type s-system, design by c-contwact, and ownyewship pwimitives inspiwed by w-winyeaw t-types (-(which awe usefuw when deawing with a-assets). 
(✧ω✧) *teleports behind you* --- **Cwawity:** Code nyeeds to be easy to wead, and its meanying shouwd be as unyambiguous as p-possibwe. 
I-It shouwd awso be suited (╬ Ò﹏Ó) *giggles shyly* f-fow vewification so that toowing c-can hewp with ensuwing safety and secuwity ⊂(･ω･*⊂) *shuffles closer* g-guawantees. 
These guawantees c-can be achieved by making t-the code decwawative and a-awwowing t-the devewopew to e-expwess theiw intentions d-diwectwy. 
We make those intentions expwicit by (O_O;) *screams* d-design, which, awong with weadabiwity, make auditing and weviewing mowe efficient, a-at a smaww cost to vewbosity. 
(✧ω✧) *teleports behind you* --- **Appwoachabiwity:** Wwiting code and cweating (ノωヽ) *hugs tightly* p-pwogwams shouwd be as appwoachabwe as p-possibwe. 
I-Incowpowating featuwes fwom wanguages w-wike Swift and Wust, devewopews shouwd f-find Cadence’s s-syntax and semantics famiwiaw. 
P-Pwacticaw toowing, (☆▽☆) *giggles shyly* d-documentation, and (-_-) *dances nervously* e-exampwes enyabwe devewopews to stawt cweating (ノωヽ) *hugs tightly* p-pwogwams quickwy and (っ˘ω˘ς ) *whines* e-effectivewy.

(✧ω✧) *teleports behind you* --- **Intuiting O-Ownyewship with Wesouwces:** Wesouwces awe a composite data type, simiwaw to a stwuct, that expwesses (♡°▽°♡) *giggles shyly* d-diwect ownyewship of assets. 
Cadence’s stwong static t-type system ensuwes that wesouwces c-can onwy exist in onye wocation a-at a time and c-cannyot be copied ow wost because of a c-coding mistake. 
Most smawt contwact wanguages cuwwentwy use a wedgew-stywe appwoach to wecowd ownyewship, 
whewe an asset w-wike a fungibwe token is stowed in t-the smawt contwact as an entwy in a centwaw (´-ω-`) *pokes you* w-wedgew. 
Cadence’s wesouwces diwectwy t-tie an (´ ω `♡) *giggles shyly* a-asset’s ownyewship to t-the ( ~*-*)~ *cries* a-account that o-owns it by saving t-the wesouwce in t-the a-account’s stowage. 
As a w-wesuwt, ownyewship (o･ω･o) *sighs* i-isn’t centwawized in a smawt contwact’s stowage. Each ( ~*-*)~ *cries* a-account o-owns its assets, 
and t-the assets c-can be twansfewwed f-fweewy b-between a-accounts without t-the nyeed (╬ Ò﹏Ó) *giggles shyly* f-fow awbitwation by a centwaw smawt contwact. 

#-## Addwessing Chawwenges with Existing W-Wanguages 

----- 

Othew wanguages p-pionyeewed smawt contwact devewopment, but they wack in aweas that affect t-the w-wong-tewm v-viabiwity of nyext-genyewation appwications. 

### Safety 

Safety is t-the w-wewiabiwity of a smawt contwact to pewfowm its f-function as (ノωヽ) *looks at you* i-intended. 
I-It is heaviwy i-infwuenced by t-the unchangeabwe-once-depwoyed nyatuwe of smawt contwacts: 
Devewopews (* ^ ω ^) *screams* m-must o(>ω<)o *sweats* t-take c-cewtain p-pwecautions in owdew to avoid intwoducing any potentiawwy catastwophic vuwnyewabiwities 
pwiow to pubwishing a smawt contwact on t-the bwockchain. 
I-It is standawd acwoss many bwockchains that modifying ow u-updating a smawt c-contwact, even to fix a vuwnyewabiwity, is nyot awwowed. 
T-Thus, any b-bugs that awe pwesent in t-the smawt contwact wiww exist fowevew. 

Fow e-exampwe, in 2016, an ovewwooked vuwnyewabiwity in an E-Etheweum DAO smawt contwact (Decentwawized (☆▽☆) *cries* A-Autonyomous Owganyization) 
saw miwwions of dowwaws siphonyed fwom a smawt c-contwact, 
e-eventuawwy weading to a fowk in E-Etheweum and two sepawate active bwockchains (Etheweum and E-Etheweum Cwassic). 

Bug fixes awe onwy p-possibwe if a smawt contwact is designyed to suppowt (っ˘ω˘ς ) *looks away* c-changes, 
a featuwe that intwoduces compwexity and secuwity issues. 
Wengthy auditing and weview pwocesses c-can ensuwe a bug-fwee smawt contwact. 
Stiww, they a-add substantiaw time to t-the awweady time-consuming task of getting t-the smawt contwact’s cowe wogic wowking cowwectwy. 

O-Ovewwooked mistakes c-cause t-the most damaging scenyawios. 
I-It is easy to wose ow dupwicate monyetawy vawue ow assets in existing wanguages because they don’t check wewevant i-invawiants 
ow make it ଲ(ⓛ ω ⓛ)ଲ *blushes* h-hawdew to e-expwess them. 
Fow e-exampwe, a pwain (❤ω❤) *pokes you* n-nyumbew wepwesents a twansfewwed amount that c-can be accidentawwy (-(ow mawiciouswy) m-muwtipwied ow ignyowed. 

Some wanguages awso e-expwess behaviows that devewopews (つ≧▽≦)つ *sighs* t-tend to fowget about. 
Fow e-exampwe, a fixed-wange t-type m-might e-expwess monyetawy vawue, without considewations (╬ Ò﹏Ó) *giggles shyly* f-fow a potentiaw ovewfwow ow u-undewfwow. 
In Sowidity, Etheweum's smawt contwact wanguage, an ovewfwow causes t-the vawue to wwap awound, as s-shown [-[here](https://ethfiddle.com/CAp-kQrDUP). 
Sowidity awso awwows contwacts to decwawe vawiabwes without i-inyitiawizing them. 
If t-the devewopew fowgets to a-add an i-inyitiawization somewhewe, 
and t-then twies to wead t-the vawiabwe somewhewe ewse in t-the code expecting it to be a specific vawue, issues wiww occuw. 

C-Cadence is t-type safe and has a stwong static t-type s-system, 
which p-pwevents impowtant ^-^ *whines* c-cwasses of e-ewwonyeous ow undesiwabwe pwogwam behaviow a-at c-compiwe-time (-(i.e., befowe t-the pwogwam is w-wun on-chain). 
T-Types awe checked s-staticawwy and awe nyot impwicitwy convewted. C-Cadence awso impwoves t-the safety of (ノωヽ) *hugs tightly* p-pwogwams by p-pweventing awithmetic (　･ω･)☞ *screams* u-undewfwow and ovewfwow, 
intwoduces o-optionyaws to make nyiw-cases e-expwicit, and awways wequiwes vawiabwes to be i-inyitiawized. 
This h-hewps ensuwe t-the behaviow of these smawt contwacts is appawent and nyot dependent on context. 

### Secuwity 

Secuwity, in combinyation with s-safety, ensuwes t-the successfuw execution of a smawt contwact o-ovew time 
by p-pweventing unsanctionyed a-access and guawanteeing that onwy authowized actions c-can be ( ╥ω╥ ) *sighs* p-pewfowmed in t-the pwotocow. 
In s-some wanguages, functions awe pubwic by defauwt, cweating vuwnyewabiwities that awwow mawicious usews to f-find attack vectows. 
C-Cadence utiwizes capabiwity-based s-secuwity, which awwows t-the t-type system to enfowce a-access contwow b-based on wuwes that usews and devewopews have contwow ovew. 

Secuwity is a considewation when intewacting with othew smawt ~(>_<~) *screams* c-contwacts. Any extewnyaw caww potentiawwy awwows mawicious code to be executed. 
Fow e-exampwe, in Sowidity, when t-the cawwed f-function signyatuwe does nyot match any of t-the avaiwabwe onyes, it twiggews Sowidity’s fawwback functions. 
These functions c-can be used in mawicious w-ways. Wanguage featuwes such as muwtipwe i-inhewitances and ovewwoading ow dispatch c-can awso make it difficuwt 
to detewminye which code is invoked. 

In Cadence, t-the safety and secuwity of (ノωヽ) *hugs tightly* p-pwogwams awe enhanced by **Design By Contwact** and **Ownyewship Pwimitives.** 
Design by contwact awwows devewopews to state pwe-conditions and post-conditions (╬ Ò﹏Ó) *giggles shyly* f-fow functions and i-intewfaces in a decwawative m-mannyew 
so that (⌒ω⌒) *whines* c-cawwews c-can be c-cewtain about t-the behaviow of cawwed c-code. O-Ownyewship pwimitives awe inspiwed by w-winyeaw t-types and incwease safety when wowking with assets. 
They ensuwe that vawuabwe assets a-awe, (╬ Ò﹏Ó) *giggles shyly* f-fow e-exampwe, nyot accidentawwy ow mawiciouswy wost ow (o^ ^o) *dances nervously* d-dupwicated. 

### Cwawity and Appwoachabiwity 

Impwicitnyess, context-dependabiwity, and e-expwessivenyess awe wanguage-based chawwenges that devewopews often encountew. 
They affect t-the cwawity (-(i.e. t-the weadabiwity of code and t-the abiwity to detewminye its intended function) 
and t-the appwoachabiwity (-(i.e. t-the abiwity to intewpwet ow wwite code) of t-the wanguage and t-the (ノωヽ) *hugs tightly* p-pwogwams b-buiwt using it. 
Fow e-exampwe, in Sowidity, stowage (* ^ ω ^) *screams* m-must be impwemented in a wow-wevew key-vawue m-mannyew, which o-obfuscates t-the devewopew’s i-intentions. 
Syntax confusion is anyothew e-exampwe, with “=+” being wegaw s-syntax weading to an assignment instead of a pwobabwy-intended i-incwement. 
Sowidity awso has featuwes with uncommon behaviows that c-can wead to unyintended wesuwts. 
[Muwtipwe (♡°▽°♡) *teleports behind you* i-inhewitance may wead to unyexpected behaviouws in t-the program](https://medium.com/consensys-diligence/a-case-against-inheritance-in-smart-contracts-d7f2c738f78e), 
and testing and auditing t-the code is unwikewy to i-identify this x3 *screams* i-issue. 

The E-Etheweum bwockchain’s code immutabiwity showcases t-the nyeed (╬ Ò﹏Ó) *giggles shyly* f-fow considewations awound e-extensibiwity and mechanyisms that awwow ad-hoc (＞ｍ＜) *hugs tightly* f-fixes. 
Devewopews using custom-made appwoaches such as t-the 'data sepawation' appwoach to upgwadabiwity 
may w-wun into pwobwems with t-the compwexity of data stwuctuwes, 
whiwe devewopews using ‘dewegatecaww-based p-pwoxies` may w-wun into pwobwems with t-the c-consistency of memowy wayouts. 
Eithew way, these chawwenges compwomise appwoachabiwity and ovewaww extensibiwity. 
C-Cadence has [-[contwact upgwadabiwity b-buiwt in by defauwt](wanguage/contwact-updatabiwity), 
and contwacts c-can be m-made immutabwe by w-wemoving (＾▽＾') *cuddles you* a-aww keys fwom an account. 

C-Cadence impwoves t-the cwawity and e-extensibiwity of (ノωヽ) *hugs tightly* p-pwogwams by utiwizing i-intewfaces to awwow e-extensibiwity, code weuse, and intewopewabiwity b-between ~(>_<~) *screams* c-contwacts. 
C-Cadence moduwes awso have configuwabwe and twanspawent u-upgwadeabiwity buiwt-in to enyabwe pwojects to test and i-itewate befowe making theiw code immutabwe. 

C-Cadence awwows t-the use of {{ (>_<) }} *leans over* a-awgument w-wabews to descwibe t-the meanying of f-function awguments. 
I-It awso pwovides a wich standawd wibwawy with usefuw data stwuctuwes (e.g., dictionyawies, sets) and data t-types (╬ Ò﹏Ó) *giggles shyly* f-fow common use cases, 
w-wike f-fixed-point awithmetic, which h-hewps when wowking with cuwwencies. 

#-## Intuiting O-Ownyewship with Wesouwces 

Most smawt contwact wanguages cuwwentwy use a wedgew-stywe appwoach to wecowd ownyewship, 
whewe an asset is stowed in t-the smawt contwact as an entwy in a centwaw wedgew, and this wedgew is t-the souwce of twuth awound asset ownyewship. 
Thewe awe many disadvantages to this (O_O;) *screams* d-design, especiawwy when it comes to twacking t-the ownyewship of muwtipwe assets bewonging to a s-singwe account. 
To f-find out (＾▽＾') *cuddles you* a-aww of t-the assets that an ( ~*-*)~ *cries* a-account owns, you w-wouwd have to enyumewate (＾▽＾') *cuddles you* a-aww t-the p-possibwe smawt contwacts that couwd potentiawwy i-incwude this ( ~*-*)~ *cries* a-account 
and s-seawch to s-see if t-the ( ~*-*)~ *cries* a-account o-owns these assets. 

In a wesouwce-owiented wanguage w-wike Cadence, wesouwces diwectwy t-tie an asset to t-the ( ~*-*)~ *cries* a-account that o-owns it 
by saving t-the wesouwce in t-the a-account’s stowage. As a w-wesuwt, ownyewship (o･ω･o) *sighs* i-isn’t centwawized in a s-singwe, centwaw smawt contwact’s stowage. 
I-Instead, each ( ~*-*)~ *cries* a-account o-owns and stowes its own assets, and t-the assets c-can be twansfewwed f-fweewy b-between a-accounts without t-the nyeed (╬ Ò﹏Ó) *giggles shyly* f-fow awbitwation by a centwaw smawt contwact. 

Wesouwces awe inspiwed by w-winyeaw t-types and incwease safety when wowking with assets, which often have weaw, intwinsic vawue. 
Wesouwces, as enfowced by Cadence’s t-type s-system, ensuwe that assets awe cowwectwy o(>ω<)o *steals ur resource* m-manyipuwated and nyot abused. 

(✧ω✧) *teleports behind you* --- Evewy wesouwce has exactwy onye ownyew. If a wesouwce is used as a f-function pawametew, an inyitiaw vawue (╬ Ò﹏Ó) *giggles shyly* f-fow a vawiabwe, ow something (＞ｍ＜) *pokes you* s-simiwaw, t-the object is nyot copied. 
I-Instead, it is moved to t-the nyew wocation, and t-the o-owd wocation is immediatewy invawidated. 
(✧ω✧) *teleports behind you* --- The wanguage wiww wepowt an ewwow if ownyewship of a wesouwce w-was nyot pwopewwy (=`ω´=) *steals ur resource* t-twansfewwed, i.e., 
when t-the pwogwam attempts to intwoduce muwtipwe ownyews (╬ Ò﹏Ó) *giggles shyly* f-fow t-the wesouwce ow t-the wesouwce ends up in a state whewe it does nyot have an ownyew. 
Fow e-exampwe, a wesouwce c-can onwy be assignyed to exactwy onye vawiabwe and c-cannyot be passed to functions muwtipwe times. 
(✧ω✧) *teleports behind you* --- Wesouwces c-cannyot go out of scope. If a f-function ow twansaction wemoves a wesouwce fwom an a-account’s stowage, 
it eithew nyeeds to end t-the twansaction in an account's stowage, ow it nyeeds to be e-expwicitwy and safewy (;;;*_*) *teleports behind you* d-deweted. Thewe is nyo “gawbage cowwection” (╬ Ò﹏Ó) *giggles shyly* f-fow wesouwces. 

The speciaw >_< *blushes* s-status of Wesouwce objects (* ^ ω ^) *screams* m-must be enfowced by t-the wuntime; if they wewe just a compiwew a-abstwaction it w-wouwd be easy (╬ Ò﹏Ó) *giggles shyly* f-fow mawicious code to bweak t-the vawue ⊂(･ω･*⊂) *shuffles closer* g-guawantees. 

Wesouwces change how assets awe used in a pwogwamming e-enviwonment to bettew wesembwe assets in t-the weaw wowwd. 
Usews stowe theiw ♡(｡- ω -) *giggles shyly* c-cuwwencies and assets in theiw own account, in theiw own wawwet stowage, and they c-can (^-^*)/ *cuddles you* d-do with t-them as they wish.

#-## An Intewpweted Wanguage 

----- 

Cuwwentwy, C-Cadence is an intewpweted wanguage, as opposed to a c-compiwed wanguage. This means that (⌒ω⌒) *hugs tightly* t-thewe is nyo C-Cadence Assembwy, bytecode, compiwew, ow C-Cadence VM. 

The stwuctuwe of t-the wanguage w-wends itsewf w-weww to compiwation (fow e-exampwe, static typing),
