# Documentation

This directory contains the documentation for Cadence.

The [`language` directory](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/tree/master/docs/language) contains the Cadence Language Reference.
The contents of this directory are deployed to the [Flow Documentation website](https://docs.onflow.org).
This is done through the `docs` directory in the [`onflow/flow` repository](https://github.com/onflow/flow),
which pulls in the content when it is built.

The remaining files in this directory can be considered developer/contributor documentation.

Documentation is written in Markdown or [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), an extension of Markdown.
