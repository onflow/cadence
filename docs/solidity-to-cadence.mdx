title: Guide for Solidity developers
---
Cadence introduces a different way to approach smart contract development which may feel unfamiliar to
Solidity developers. There are fundamental mindset and platform differences, and also several new language
features that have no real equivalent in Solidity. This guide outlines high level design and conceptual
aspects of Flow and Cadence that are essential to understand, platform and integration differences, as well
as detailed guidance on how to perform certain common Solidity development tasks using Cadence idioms. We also
provide details on how best to leverage Cadence's unique features and how to avoid common pitfalls that may come
up while transitioning.

# Conceptual foundations for Cadence

A fundamental difference to get used to when adjusting to Cadence from Solidity is of mindset. Security and
interoperability on Ethereum are designed around addresses (or more specifically the account associated with an
address), resulting in all contracts having to carefully track and evaluate access and authorizations.

Transactions are based on who authorized them, which is provided as `msg.sender` in the transaction context.
User to contract, or contract to contract interactions must be explicitly coded to ensure the appropriate approvals
have been made before interacting with a contract. The contract based nature of storage means that user ownership
in Ethereum is represented in a mapping, for example from owner to balance, or token ID to owner. Put another
way, ownership is tracked in ledger records similar to a person's bank balance. Crypto wallets help combine
balances from multiple token types into a convenient view for the user.

Cadence introduces new primitives and distinct functionalities, namely Resources and Capabilities, that are designed
around Flow's account model. Resources are first-class language types which are unique, non-copyable, and which cannot
be discarded. These properties make Resources ideal for representing tokens that are always limited in numbers.
Resources are always stored in account storage and contracts control access to them using Capabilities. Capabilities
are another special type that secure protected resources without the need for tracking addresses. Cadence makes
working with these straightforward and intuitive to those familiar with object-oriented programming languages.

Newcomers to Cadence should ensure they understand the following major concepts before development.

## Flow account model

The [Flow account model](learn#concepts#accounts-and-keys) in Cadence combines storage for the keys and code
(”smart contracts”) associated with an account with storage for the assets owned by that account. That’s right:
In Cadence, your tokens are stored in your account, and not in a smart contract. Of course, smart contracts still
define these assets and how they behave, but those assets can be securely stored in a user’s account through the
magic of Resources.

There is only one account type in Cadence also with an account address, similar to an Externally-Owned-Account
(EOA) address in Ethereum. However, unlike Ethereum contract-accounts, accounts in Cadence also store contract code.
Accounts realize ownership on Flow in being the container where keys, Resources, and contracts are stored on-chain.

### PublicAccount and AuthAccount

Fields, functions, Resources and/or Capabilities in a contract use [access modifiers](language/access-control)
protecting privileged functionality or making it public. `PublicAccount` is the publicly available part of an account
through which public functions or objects can be accessed by any account using the `getAccount` function.

`AuthAccount` is available only to the signer of the transaction. An `AuthAccount` reference provides full access
to that account's storage, public keys and contract code. Capabilities ensure that resources held in an account can be
safely shared/accessed; access to `AuthAccount` should never be given to other accounts.

## Resources

Resources are unique, [linear-types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substructural_type_system#Linear_type_systems) which
can never be copied or implicitly discarded, only moved between accounts. If, during development, a function fails to
store a Resource obtained from an account in the function scope, semantic checks will flag an error. The run-time
enforces the same strict rules in terms of allowed operations. Therefore, contract functions which do not properly
handle Resources in scope before exiting will abort, reverting them to the original storage. These features of
Resources make them perfect for representing tokens, both fungible and non-fungible. Ownership is tracked by where
they are stored, and the assets can’t be duplicated or accidentally lost since the language itself enforces correctness.

Flow encourages storing of data and compute on-chain and Resource-types makes this easier than even. Since Resources
are always stored in accounts, any data that exists in Resource instances is seamlessly being managed on-chain
without any explicit handling needed.

## Capability-based access

Remote access to stored objects can be managed via [Capabilities](language#capability-based-access-control). This
means that if an account wants to be able to access another account's stored objects, it must have been provided
with a valid Capability to that object. Capabilities can be either public or private. An account can share a public
Capability if it wants to give all other accounts access. (For example, it’s common for an account to accept fungible
token deposits from all sources via a public Capability.) Alternatively, an account can grant private Capabilities
to specific accounts in order to provide access to restricted functionality. For example, an NFT project often
controls minting through an “administrator Capability” that grants specific accounts with the power to mint new tokens.

## Contract standards

There are numerous widely-used contract standards established to benefit the ecosystem, for example
[Fungible Token](flow#core-contracts#fungible-token)(FT) and [Non-Fungible Token](flow#core-contracts#non-fungible-token)(NFT)
standards which are conceptually equivalent to Ethereum's ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards. Cadence's object-oriented
design means standards apply through contract sub-types such as Resources, Resource interfaces, or other types
declared in the contract standard. Standards can define and limit behaviour and/or set conditions which
implementations of the standard cannot violate.

Detailed information about available standards and other core contracts can be found in [Core contracts](flow#core-contracts).

# Security and access control

Decentralized application development places significant focus on security and access and can fairly be described
as security engineering. Understanding how Resources, Capabilities and the account model solve this may not
be obvious when viewed from a Solidity perspective.

## msg.sender considered harmful

The first question that every Solidity developer asks when they start programming in Cadence is:

**"How do I get the account who authorized the transaction?"**

In Ethereum this account is referred to as `msg.sender` and informs the program flow in a function depending on who
authorized it. Doing so is key to access and security, and is the basis of identity and ownership on Ethereum.

Cadence does not have `msg.sender` and there is no transaction-level way for Cadence contract to uniquely identify the
calling account. Even if there was a way to access it, Cadence supports [multi-sig](solidity-to-cadence#multi-key-multi-signature-support)
transactions, meaning that a list of all the signers' accounts would be returned.

The reason `msg.sender` is both unsupported and strongly advised against is because Cadence uses Capabilities for
access rather than addresses. The mindset change that developers need to adjust to is that a capability must first be
obtained by the authorizing account (called provider or signer in Cadence) from the contract that will require it,
which then enables the requesting account to access the protected function or Resource. This means the contract never
needs to know who the signer is before proceeding because the capability **IS** the authorization.

The [capability-based security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security) model frames access in
the opposite direction than the [access-based security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access-control_list) model.

<Img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/flow-resources/documentation-assets/solidity-to-cadence/capability-based-security.png" />

## Access control using Capabilities

Solidity lacks specific types or other primitives to aid with permission management. Developers have to inline
guards to `require` at every function entry-point, thus validating the `msg.sender` of the transaction.

[Capabilities](language#capability-based-access-control) are defined by linking storage paths (namespaces for contract
storage) to protected objects and then making that linked capability available to other accounts. Public and private
scopes defined for storage paths and Capabilities themselves align precisely with
[PublicAccount](language#accounts#publicaccount)/[AuthAccount](language#accounts#authaccount) account scopes.

Any account can get access to an account's public Capabilities. Public capabilities are created using public paths,
i.e. they have the domain `public`. For example, all accounts have a default public capability linked to the
`FlowToken.Vault` Resource. This vault is exposed as a public capability, scoped to the `receiver` resource interface,
to allow any account to `borrow()` a reference to the Vault to make a `deposit()`. Since only the functions defined under the `FungibleToken.Receiver` interface are exposed, the borrower of the vault reference cannot call `withdraw()` since it is scoped in the `provider` interface. Public capabilities can be obtained from both
authorized accounts (`AuthAccount`) and public accounts (`PublicAccount`).

Private capabilities are specifically granted to accounts. They are created using private paths, i.e. they have the
domain `private`. After creation, they can be obtained from authorised account objects (`AuthAccount`) but not public
accounts (`PublicAccount`). To share a private Capability with another account, the owning account must `publish` it
to another account which places in the [account inbox](language#accounts#account-inbox). The recipient can later
claim the Capability from the account inbox using then `claim` function.

Capabilities can be `unpublished` and can also be [revoked](design-patterns#capability-revocation) by the creating
account.

To aid automation, events are emitted for `publish`, `claim` and `unpublish` actions completed for a Capability.

Detailed information can be found in [Capabilities](language#capability-based-access-control).

## Hygiene factors for protecting value

While capabilities grant account access to a protected resource, it's still necessary to impose controls on value
accessed through them. For example, if your use-case requires delegating access to a `FlowToken.Vault` to
`withdraw()` funds, it's important to limit the amount. Tokens implementing FT/NFT standards are the primary type of
value being exchanged by accounts on Flow. The standard provides the primitives needed to implement capability
limiting best-practices.

### Token isolation

All FTs reside in a `Vault` Resource and each different FT will exist as a separate `Vault` in an account. Similarly,
all NFTs implement a `Collection` Resource, in which those NFTs held by an account for that collection are stored.

Whenever access to the `withdraw()` function has to be delegated to another account, the simplest way to limit how
many tokens of a given type can be withdrawn is to create a new `Vault` Resource for that token type and move a smaller
amount of the tokens in the main token `Vault`. A capability is then linked to that `Vault` instance before being
made available to another account.

A similar pattern can be used for NFTs, where a new `Collection` Resource can be created into which only those NFTs
which should be exposed are moved. A capability is then linked to that `Collection` instance before being made
available to another account.

### Bespoke control strategies

For more complex use-cases one might create new Resource that implements the relevant interfaces to match those of
the underlying protected Resource(s). The code for the new Resource can then enforce limits as required and control
how and when delegation to the underlying resource occurs.

## Admin roles

Compared to Solidity, creating an admin role in Cadence requires a little more code, all of which is encapsulated
within a Resource. The admin object design can be highly customized and employ Capabilities for fine-grained control
such as limiting access to individual functions, on a per-account basis if required. The complexity needed for admin
roles may vary, for example, larger organizations may require more complex role-based-access schemes. The use of a
Resource in this context is key - the instance can't be copied and the account with the first edition mint of the admin
serves as the root-admin. The admin can be implemented to mint additional admin Resource instances, which only the
root-admin can grant to selected user accounts via a Capability. Conveniently, because the admin role is only
accessible via a Capability it's easy to manage with [Capability Revocation](design-patterns#capability-revocation).

The admin role originates from the [init singleton pattern](design-patterns#init-singleton) and uses the
[Capability Bootstrapping](design-patterns#capability-bootstrapping) pattern for making the Capability available to
other accounts.

An example admin role implementation is available in [Caadence cookbook](https://cookbook.onflow.org/?preview=13).

### Role-based access

Implementing role-based-access can be achieved by defining roles implemented as Resources managed by the
root-admin account. Roles can provide limited access to functions which guard other protected resources, with access
levels and/or what is exposed varying from role to role. The root-admin can grant accounts access to individual
roles through a private capability. Functions that the roles are permitted to invoke may be scoped as
`access(contract)` to enforce that they can only be called by code paths in the root-admin contract.

# Other best practices and conventions

Certain well established best practices for Solidity may not apply or are handled differently.

## Check effects interactions

Solidity contracts must use the [check effect interaction](https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/checks_effects_interactions.html)
because functions are public by default and address-based access means that guards must exist when program flow
concedes control to an external contract. There are two reasons why this is significantly less of a problem in
Cadence. Functions are private by default and the language provides a range of [access scopes](language#access-control).
More importantly, 'risks associated with ceding control to an external contract' is an Ethereum phenomenon;
the risk no longer applies because access control is handled with Capabilities while assets remain stored safely
in accounts.

## Guard Check

Solidity uses `revert`, `require` & `assert` to validate inputs. `require` is a product of the address-based nature
of Solidity which Capabilities replace. `revert` is similar to Cadence's `panic` in that a transaction is aborted.
Cadence provides an `assert` operator which mirrors `assert` in Solidity.

## Modifiers

Modifiers are extensively used in Solidity when enforcing pre-checks within a function. This is a powerful language
feature. However, modifiers can also mutate state which introduces risks to program control flow.

Cadence uses `pre` and `post` blocks to validate input values or the function execution outputs. Notably, `pre` and
`post` block prohibit changing of state and may only enforce conditions.

Another difference is that modifiers in Solidity can be re-used within the contract multiple times. Cadence
`pre` & `post` blocks are associated to individual functions only, reducing the likelihood of errors but which
results in a small amount of code duplication.

## Error handling

Solidity offers try/catch block to handle errors, however, there is no equivalent in Cadence. This is because
Resources and Capabilities codify the complexity of access and security in first-class types and

# Integration differences

## Scripts and transactions

Another major difference between Cadence and Solidity is that deployed contracts are not the only code being executed
in the VM. Cadence offers scripts, of which a subset are transactions, and both permit arbitrary code. Scripts or
transactions are not deployed on-chain and always exist off-chain, however, they are the top-level code payload
being executed by the execution runtime. Clients send scripts and transactions through the Flow Access API gRPC or
REST endpoints, returning results to clients when applicable. Scripts and transactions enable more efficient and
powerful ways to integrate dapps with the underlying blockchain, where contracts can more purely be thought of as
services or components, with scripts or transactions becoming the dapp-specific API interface for chain interactions.

Scripts are read-only in nature, requiring only a `main` function declaration and which perform
[queries](https://github.com/onflow/flow-ft/blob/master/transactions/scripts/get_balance.cdc) against chain state, eg:

```jsx
// This script reads the balance field of an account's ExampleToken Balance
import FungibleToken from "../../contracts/FungibleToken.cdc"
import ExampleToken from "../../contracts/ExampleToken.cdc"

pub fun main(account: Address): UFix64 {
    let acct = getAccount(account)
    let vaultRef = acct.getCapability(ExampleToken.VaultPublicPath)
        .borrow<&ExampleToken.Vault{FungibleToken.Balance}>()
        ?? panic("Could not borrow Balance reference to the Vault")

    return vaultRef.balance
}
```

[Transactions](https://github.com/onflow/flow-ft/tree/master/transactions) are an ACID (Atomic, Consistent,
Isolated and Durable) version of scripts having only `prepare` and `execute` functions that either succeed in
full and mutate chain state as described, or otherwise fail and mutate nothing. They also support setting of `pre`
and `post` conditions. In the example transaction below `ExampleToken`s are deposited into multiple `receiver`
vaults for each address in the input map.

```jsx
import FungibleToken from "../contracts/FungibleToken.cdc"
import ExampleToken from "../contracts/ExampleToken.cdc"

/// Transfers tokens to a list of addresses specified in the `addressAmountMap` parameter
transaction(addressAmountMap: {Address: UFix64}) {

    // The Vault resource that holds the tokens that are being transferred
    let vaultRef: &ExampleToken.Vault

    prepare(signer: AuthAccount) {

        // Get a reference to the signer's stored vault
        self.vaultRef = signer.borrow<&ExampleToken.Vault>(from: ExampleToken.VaultStoragePath)
			?? panic("Could not borrow reference to the owner's Vault!")
    }

    execute {

        for address in addressAmountMap.keys {

            // Withdraw tokens from the signer's stored vault
            let sentVault <- self.vaultRef.withdraw(amount: addressAmountMap[address]!)

            // Get the recipient's public account object
            let recipient = getAccount(address)

            // Get a reference to the recipient's Receiver
            let receiverRef = recipient.getCapability(ExampleToken.ReceiverPublicPath)
                .borrow<&{FungibleToken.Receiver}>()
                ?? panic("Could not borrow receiver reference to the recipient's Vault")

            // Deposit the withdrawn tokens in the recipient's receiver
            receiverRef.deposit(from: <-sentVault)

        }
    }
}
```

Transactions can encompass an arbitrary number withdrawals/deposits, across multiple FTs, sending to multiple
addresses, or other more complex variations, all of which will succeed or fail in their entirety given their
ACID properties.

## Multi-key, multi-signature support

Solidity supports only one kind of multi-signature scheme where n out of m (assuming m > n) approvals need to be
obtained to execute the transaction from the multi-signature smart contract. The most used multi-signature smart
contract in the Ethereum ecosystem is the gnosis [safe contract](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts/blob/main/contracts/GnosisSafe.sol).
However, Solidity lacks support for signature aggregation or BLS signature schemes.

Cadence offers a wide range of options to implement various multi-signature schemes.

- Inherent support for multi-sign transactions.
- Resource transfer scheme.
- Inherent support of BLS signature scheme.

Flow account keys have assigned weights, where a 1000 unit weight is the cumulative weight needed from signing
keys to execute a transaction successfully. One can divide weights across multiple keys and distribute those partial
weighted keys to authorized signers. When signing the transaction, all signers must sign the transaction together
in a short period of time in order for the cumulative weight to reach 1000 units.

See [BLS Signature scheme](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/language/crypto/#bls-multi-signature) for a detailed
overview of the inherent support of BLS signatures.

### Resource transfer scheme

The main limitation of multi-sig transactions is that signatures must all be made for the transaction within a
relatively short time window. If this window is missed, the transaction will abort. The resource transfer scheme is
very similar to the Solidity multi-signature smart contract. A Resource is created that has the functionality to
proxy the execution of a fund transfer. This Resource is handed from one signer to the next to collect signatures.
Once the threshold of required signatures is met the transaction is executed. The elapsed time The main drawback
with this approach is that does not support execution of arbitrary functionality.

# Other platform differences

The following differences unrelated to implementing Cadence contracts are useful to understand in the context
of application design.

## Events

Flow uses [events](language#events) extensively to provide real-time signals to off-chain systems about particular
actions that occurred during a transaction. The main difference on Flow is that events remain part of the history
and are not purged from storage. Events can be populated with arbitrary data that will assist consumers of the
event. Builders are encouraged to leverage events for seamless UX as users perform transactions.

## Contract upgradeability

Flow supports limited upgradability of Cadence contracts which is most helpful during development. The following function
shows how the account owner can update a contract. Upgrades are analyzed for prohibited changes once uploaded for
upgrade. Upgradeability is still an early phase feature, which will continue to improve over time.

```solidity
fun update__experimental(name: String, code: [UInt8]): DeployedContract
```

To enforce immutability once a contract is tested and ready to deploy, account owners can optionally revoke keys
from the account containing the contract.

Detailed information about the cadence upgradeability is available in [Contract updatability](language#contract-updatability/).

## Account key formulation

In EVM-based chains, an address is derived from a cryptographically generated public key and can have a single private
key, supporting one type of signature curve, i.e. ECDSA. They are not verifiable off-chain and typos/truncation in an
address may result in funds being lost.

Flow account addresses have a special format and are verifiable off-chain. Verifying address format validity can be
done using an error detection algorithm based on linear code. While this does not also confirm that an address is active
on-chain the extra verifiability is a useful safeguard.

## Contract size constraints

Solidity developers will be well aware of the [EIP-170](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-170) deployable contract
bytecode size limit of 24KB. This can burden builders who need to optimize contract bytecode size, sometimes even
requiring a re-design of contracts to break it into smaller contract parts.

By contrast, Cadence has no inherent or defined smart contract size limit. However, it is restricted by the transaction
size limit which is 1.5MB. With very rare exceptions, it’s unlikely that this limit would pose a problem to those
developing Cadence contracts. Should it be needed, there is a known way to deploy a contract exceeding 1.5 MB which we
will document at a later time.

# Low level language differences

## Arithmetic

Historically, Solidity, smart contracts lost millions of dollars because of improper handling of arithmetic
under/overflows. Contemporary Solidity versions offer inbuilt handling of under/overflow for arithmetic operations.

Cadence implements [saturating math](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturation_arithmetic) that avoids
overflow/underflow.

## Optional support

[Optional bindings](language#control-flow) provide in-built conditional handling of nil values. Optionals have two
cases: either there is a value, or there is nothing; they fork program flow based on whether a value is nil or not.

## Iterable Dictionaries

Solidity offers the mapping type, however, it is not iterable. Because of that dApp developers have to run off-chain
services to know all the keys to the mapping. This also pushes builders to create custom datatypes like EnumerableMap
which adds to gas costs.

Cadence offers the [Dictionary](language#control-flow) type, an unordered collection of key-value associations
which is iterable.

## Rich support for type utility functions

Cadence offers numerous native-type utility functions to simplify development. For example, the String type
provides:
- utf8
- concat()
- slice()
- decodeHex()
- encodeHex()
- toLower()
- length

## Argument labelling

Argument labels in Cadence help to disambiguate input values. They makes code more readable and explicit. They
also eliminate confusion around the order of arguments when working with the same type. They must be included in the function call. This restriction can be skipped if the label is preceded by `_ ` on its declaration.

Eg:
`fun foo(balance: UFix64)`
called as
`self.foo(balance: 30.0)`

`fun foo( _balance: UFix64)`
can be called as
`self.foo(balance: 30.0)`
or as
`self.foo(30.0)`
