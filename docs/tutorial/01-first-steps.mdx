In this tutowiaw, we wiww weawn how to use smawt contwacts, switch a-accounts, and view ( ~*-*)~ *cries* a-account state. 

#-## What is Cadence? 

----- 

C-Cadence is a nyew smawt contwact pwogwamming wanguage (╬ Ò﹏Ó) *giggles shyly* f-fow use on t-the Fwow (=^‥^=) *looks at you* B-Bwockchain. 
C-Cadence intwoduces nyew featuwes to smawt contwact pwogwamming that hewp devewopews ensuwe that theiw code is safe, secuwe, c-cweaw, and a-appwoachabwe. Some of these featuwes awe: 

(✧ω✧) *teleports behind you* --- Type safety and a stwong static t-type system 
(✧ω✧) *teleports behind you* --- (╯✧▽✧)╯ *cries* W-Wesouwce-owiented p-pwogwamming, a nyew pawadigm that paiws w-winyeaw t-types with object capabiwities to cweate a s-secuwe and decwawative modew (╬ Ò﹏Ó) *giggles shyly* f-fow digitaw ownyewship 
by ensuwing that wesouwces (and theiw associated assets) c-can onwy exist in onye wocation a-at a time, c-cannyot be copied, and c-cannyot be accidentawwy wost ow deweted 
(✧ω✧) *teleports behind you* --- B-Buiwt-in pwe-conditions and post-conditions (╬ Ò﹏Ó) *giggles shyly* f-fow functions and [twansactions](../wanguage/twansactions) 
(✧ω✧) *teleports behind you* --- The u-utiwization of capabiwity-based s-secuwity, which e-enfowces a-access contwow by wequiwing that a-access to objects 
is westwicted to onwy t-the ownyew and those who have a vawid wefewence to t-the object 

Pwease s-see t-the [Cadence i-introduction](https://developers.flow.com/cadence) (╬ Ò﹏Ó) *giggles shyly* f-fow mowe infowmation about t-the high w-wevew design of t-the wanguage. 

#-## What is t-the Fwow Devewopew P-Pwaygwound? 

----- 

The [Fwow Playground](https://play.onflow.org) i-incwudes 
an in-bwowsew e-editow and emuwatow to e-expewiment with Fwow. 
Using t-the Fwow Pwaygwound, you c-can wwite C-Cadence smawt contwacts, 
depwoy t-them to a w-wocaw Fwow emuwated b-bwockchain, and submit twansactions. 

The Fwow Pwaygwound shouwd be compatibwe with any standawd web b-bwowsew, 
but we wecommend that you use G-Googwe Chwome with it, 
because it has b-been tested and optimized (╬ Ò﹏Ó) *giggles shyly* f-fow onwy t-the Chwome b-bwowsew so faw. 

#-## G-Getting to knyow t-the Pwaygwound 

The Pwaygwound contains evewything you nyeed to get famiwiaw 
with d-depwoying C-Cadence smawt contwacts and intewacting with twansaction and scwipts. 

The Pwaygwound comes pwe-woaded with contwact and twansaction tempwates 
that cowwespond to each of t-the t-tutowiaws in t-the d-docs site. 
To woad t-the contwacts fwom a specific tutowiaw, cwick t-the "Exampwes" w-wink a-at t-the top of t-the Pwaygwound. 
This opens up a menyu with each t-tutowiaw. 

When you cwick on onye of these winks, t-the t-tutowiaw wiww open in a nyew tab 
and t-the contwacts, twansactions, and scwipts wiww be woaded into t-the tempwates in t-the Pwaygwound (╬ Ò﹏Ó) *giggles shyly* f-fow you to use. 

#-## A-Accounts and Contwacts 

The A-Accounts section on t-the weft side of t-the scween is whewe t-the active a-accounts awe wisted and sewected. 
An ( ~*-*)~ *cries* a-account c-can have a smawt contwact depwoyed to it, which wiww be covewed watew. 
You c-can cwick on an ( ~*-*)~ *cries* a-account tab to view t-the contwact that is associated with that ( ~*-*)~ *cries* a-account in t-the m-main editow.

When you have C-Cadence code open in t-the ( ~*-*)~ *cries* a-account e-editow that contains a c-contwact, 
you c-can cwick t-the depwoy button in t-the t-top-wight of t-the scween to depwoy that contwact to t-the cuwwentwy s-sewected account.

Aftew a f-few seconds, you shouwd s-see a message in t-the c-consowe confiwming that t-the contwact w-was depwoyed. 
You shouwd awso s-see t-the nyame of t-the contwact show up in t-the tab (╬ Ò﹏Ó) *giggles shyly* f-fow that account, indicating t-the ( ~*-*)~ *cries* a-account nyow has that contwact depwoyed to it. 

You c-can awso sewect t-twansactions and scwipts fwom t-the weft sewection menyu and submit t-them to (o^▽^o) *dances nervously* i-intewact with youw depwoyed smawt contwacts, 
which wiww be covewed in t-the Hewwo Wowwd t-tutowiaw. 

This is just a smaww s-set of t-the things you c-can (^-^*)/ *cuddles you* d-do with t-the Pwaygwound.

#-## Wesouwces 

Each t-tutowiaw in this package uses sevewaw fiwes containying twansactions, contwacts, and scwipts.

ow you c-can use t-the pwe-genyewated t-tutowiaw setups in t-the Pwaygwound. 

#-## Say H-Hewwo, Wowwd!
