The NFT is an integral part of blockchain technology. We need NFTs to represent assets that are unique and indivisible (like CryptoKitties! Or Top Shot Moments!).

Instead of being represented in a central ledger, like in most smart contract languages, Cadence represents each NFT as a resource object that users store in their accounts.

We're going to take you through these steps to get comfortable with the NFT:

1. Deploy the NFT contract and type definitions.
2. Create an NFT object and store it in your account storage.
3. Create an NFT collection object to store multiple NFTs in your account.
4. Create an `NFTMinter` and use it to mint an NFT.
5. Create references to your collection that others can use to send you tokens.
6. Set up another account the same way.
7. Transfer an NFT from one account to another.
8. Use a script to see what NFTs are stored in each account's collection.

**Before proceeding with this tutorial**, we highly recommend following the instructions in [Getting Started](/cadence/tutorial/01-first-steps/),
[Hello, World!](/cadence/tutorial/02-hello-world/), and [Fungible Tokens](/cadence/tutorial/03-fungible-tokens/)
to learn how to use the Playground tools and to learn the fundamentals of Cadence. We will cover some of the concepts again here, but not all.

## Non-Fungible Tokens on the Flow Emulator

---

In Cadence, each NFT is represented by a resource with an integer ID. Resources are a perfect type to represent NFTs
because resources have important ownership rules that are enforced by the type system.
They can only have one owner, cannot be copied, and cannot be accidentally or maliciously lost or duplicated.
These protections ensure that owners know that their NFT is safe and can represent an asset that has real value.

An NFT is also usually represented by some sort of metadata like a name or a picture. Historically, most of this metadata has been stored off-chain,
and the on-chain token only contains a URL or something similar that points to the off-chain metadata.
In Flow, this is possible, but the goal is to make it possible for all the metadata associated with a token to be stored on-chain.
This is out of the scope of this tutorial though.
This paradigm is still being designed and you can participate by seeing the [relevant issue](https://github.com/onflow/flow-nft/issues/9) in the flow NFT repository.

When users on Flow want to transact with each other, they can do so peer-to-peer and without having to interact with a central NFT contract
by calling resource-defined methods in each users' account.

## Adding an NFT Your Account

---

<Callout type="info">

First, you'll need to follow this link to open a playground session with the Non-Fungible Token contracts, transactions, and scripts pre-loaded:

<a

</a>

</Callout>

<Callout type="info">

Open Account `0x01` to see `NFTv1.cdc`.
`NFTv1.cdc` should contain the following code:

</Callout>

```cadence:title=NFTv1.cdc
pub contract ExampleNFT {

    // Declare the NFT resource type
    pub resource NFT {
        // The unique ID that differentiates each NFT
        pub let id: UInt64

        // String mapping to hold metadata
        pub var metadata: {String: String}

        // Initialize both fields in the init function
        init(initID: UInt64) {
            self.id = initID
            self.metadata = {}
        }
    }

    // Create a single new NFT and save it to account storage
    init() {
        self.account.save<@NFT>(<-create NFT(initID: 1), to: /storage/NFT1)
    }
}
```

In this contract, the NFT is a resource with an integer ID and a field for metadata.

This is different from the Fungible Token because a fungible token simply was a vault with a balance
that could change when tokens were withdrawn or deposited.
Each NFT resource has a unique ID, so they cannot be combined or duplicated, unless the smart contract allows it.

Another unique feature of this design is that each NFT can contain its own metadata.
In this example, we use a simple `String`-to-`String` mapping, but you could imagine a much more rich
version that can allow the storage of complex file formats and other such data.

An NFT could even own other NFTs! This example is shown in a later tutorial.

In the contract's `init` function, we create a new NFT object and move it into the account storage.

```cadence
// put it in storage
self.account.save<@NFT>(<-create NFT(initID: 1), to: /storage/NFT1)
```

Here we access the `AuthAccount` object on the account the contract is deployed to and call its `save` method,
specifying `@NFT` as the type it is being saved as. We also create the NFT in the same line and pass it as the first argument to `save`.
We save it to the `/storage` domain, where objects are meant to be stored.

<Callout type="info">

Deploy `NFTv1` by clicking the Deploy button in the bottom right of the editor.

</Callout>

You should now have an NFT in your account. Let's run a transaction to check.

<Callout type="info">

Open the `NFT Exists` transaction, select account `0x01` as the only signer, and send the transaction.<br/>
`NFT Exists` should look like this:

</Callout>

```cadence:title=NFT Exists.cdc
import ExampleNFT from 0x01

// This transaction checks if an NFT exists in the storage of the given account
// by trying to borrow from it
transaction {
    prepare(acct: AuthAccount) {
        if acct.borrow<&ExampleNFT.NFT>(from: /storage/NFT1) != nil {
            log("The token exists!")
        } else {
            log("No token found!")
        }
    }
}
```

Here, we are trying to directly borrow a reference from the NFT in storage.
If the object exists, the borrow will succeed and the reference optional will not be `nil`, but if the borrow fails, the optional will be `nil`.

You should see something that says `"The token exists!"`.

Good work! You have your first NFT in your account.

## Storing Multiple NFTs in a Collection

---

We could store our NFTs at the top level of storage, but this could start to get confusing to organize all your NFTs if you have many.
This approach is not as scalable, but we can overcome this issue by using a data structure that can hold as many NFTs as we want.
We can accomplish this via an array or dictionary, but those types are relatively opaque.
Instead, we can use a resource as our NFT collection to enable more-sophisticated ways to interact with our NFTs.

<Callout type="info">

Open Account `0x02` to see `NFTv2.cdc`.<br/>
Deploy the contract by clicking the Deploy button in the bottom right of the editor.<br/>
`NFTv2.cdc` should contain the code below.
It contains what was already in `NFTv1.cdc` plus additional resource declarations in the contract body.

</Callout>

```cadence:title=NFTv2.cdc
// NFTv2.cdc
//
// This is a complete version of the ExampleNFT contract
// that includes withdraw and deposit functionality, as well as a
// collection resource that can be used to bundle NFTs together.
//
// It also includes a definition for the Minter resource,
// which can be used by admins to mint new NFTs.
//
// Learn more about non-fungible tokens in this tutorial: https://docs.onflow.org/docs/non-fungible-tokens

pub contract ExampleNFT {

    // Declare the NFT resource type
    pub resource NFT {
        // The unique ID that differentiates each NFT
        pub let id: UInt64

        // Initialize both fields in the init function
        init(initID: UInt64) {
            self.id = initID
        }
    }

    // We define this interface purely as a way to allow users
    // to create public, restricted references to their NFT Collection.
    // They would use this to only expose the deposit, getIDs,
    // and idExists fields in their Collection
    pub resource interface NFTReceiver {

        pub fun deposit(token: @NFT)

        pub fun getIDs(): [UInt64]

        pub fun idExists(id: UInt64): Bool
    }

    // The definition of the Collection resource that
    // holds the NFTs that a user owns
    pub resource Collection: NFTReceiver {
        // dictionary of NFT conforming tokens
        // NFT is a resource type with an `UInt64` ID field
        pub var ownedNFTs: @{UInt64: NFT}

        // Initialize the NFTs field to an empty collection
        init () {
            self.ownedNFTs <- {}
        }

        // withdraw
        //
        // Function that removes an NFT from the collection
        // and moves it to the calling context
        pub fun withdraw(withdrawID: UInt64): @NFT {
            // If the NFT isn't found, the transaction panics and reverts
            let token <- self.ownedNFTs.remove(key: withdrawID)!

            return <-token
        }

        // deposit
        //
        // Function that takes a NFT as an argument and
        // adds it to the collections dictionary
        pub fun deposit(token: @NFT) {
            // add the new token to the dictionary with a force assignment
            // if there is already a value at that key, it will fail and revert
            self.ownedNFTs[token.id] <-! token
        }

        // idExists checks to see if a NFT
        // with the given ID exists in the collection
        pub fun idExists(id: UInt64): Bool {
            return self.ownedNFTs[id] != nil
        }

        // getIDs returns an array of the IDs that are in the collection
        pub fun getIDs(): [UInt64] {
            return self.ownedNFTs.keys
        }

        destroy() {
            destroy self.ownedNFTs
        }
    }

    // creates a new empty Collection resource and returns it
    pub fun createEmptyCollection(): @Collection {
        return <- create Collection()
    }

    // NFTMinter
    //
    // Resource that would be owned by an admin or by a smart contract
    // that allows them to mint new NFTs when needed
    pub resource NFTMinter {

        // the ID that is used to mint NFTs
        // it is only incremented so that NFT ids remain
        // unique. It also keeps track of the total number of NFTs
        // in existence
        pub var idCount: UInt64

        init() {
            self.idCount = 1
        }

        // mintNFT
        //
        // Function that mints a new NFT with a new ID
        // and returns it to the caller
        pub fun mintNFT(): @NFT {

            // create a new NFT
            var newNFT <- create NFT(initID: self.idCount)

            // change the id so that each ID is unique
            self.idCount = self.idCount + 1 as UInt64

            return <-newNFT
        }
    }

	init() {
		// store an empty NFT Collection in account storage
        self.account.save(<-self.createEmptyCollection(), to: /storage/NFTCollection)

        // publish a reference to the Collection in storage
        self.account.link<&{NFTReceiver}>(/public/NFTReceiver, target: /storage/NFTCollection)

        // store a minter resource in account storage
        self.account.save(<-create NFTMinter(), to: /storage/NFTMinter)
	}
}



```

Any user who owns one or more `ExampleNFT` will have an instance of this `ExampleNFT.Collection` resource stored in their account.
This collection stores all of their NFTs in a dictionary that maps integer IDs to `NFT`s,
similar to how a `Vault` resource stores all the tokens in the `balance` field.
Another similarity is how each collection has a `deposit` and `withdraw` function.
These functions allow users to follow the pattern of first withdrawing the token from their collection and then depositing to another collection.

When a user wants to store NFTs in their account,
they will instantiate an empty `Collection` by calling the `createEmptyCollection` function in the `ExampleNFT` smart contract.
This returns an empty `Collection` object that they can store in their account storage.

There are a few new features that we use in this example, so let's walk through them.

## Dictionaries

This resource uses a [**Dictionary**: a mutable, unordered collection of key-value associations](/cadence/language/values-and-types#dictionaries).

```cadence
pub var ownedNFTs: @{Int: NFT}
```

In a dictionary, all keys must have the same type, and all values must have the same type.
In this case, we are mapping integer IDs to `NFT` resource objects.
Dictionary definitions don't usually have the `@` symbol in the type specification,
but because the `ownedNFTs` mapping stores resources, the whole field also has to become a resource type,
which is why the field has the `@` symbol indicating that it is a resource type. This means that all the rules that apply to resources apply to this type.

If the NFT collection resource is destroyed with the `destroy` command, it needs to know what to do with the resources it stores in the dictionary.
This is why resources that store other resources have to include a `destroy` function that runs when `destroy` is called on it.
This destroy function has to either explicitly destroy the contained resources or move them somewhere else. In this example, we destroy them.

```cadence
destroy() {
    destroy self.ownedNFTs
}
```

When the collection is created, the `init` function is run and must explicitly initialize all member variables.
This helps prevent issues in some smart contracts where uninitialized fields can cause bugs.
The init function can never run again after this. Here, we initialize the dictionary as a resource type with an empty dictionary.

```cadence
init () {
  self.ownedNFTs <- {}
}
```

Another feature for dictionaries is the ability to get an array of the keys of the dictionary using the built-in `keys` function.

```cadence
// getIDs returns an array of the IDs that are in the collection
pub fun getIDs(): [UInt64] {
    return self.ownedNFTs.keys
}
```

This can be used to iterate through the dictionary or just to see a list of what is stored.
As you can see, a variable length array type is declared by enclosing the member type within square brackets.

## Resources Owning Resources

This NFT Collection example in `NFTv2.cdc` illustrates an important feature: resources can own other resources.

In the example, a user can transfer one NFT to another user.
Additionally, since the `Collection` explicitly owns the NFTs in it,
the owner could transfer all of the NFTs at once by just transferring the single collection.

This is an important feature because it enables numerous additional use cases.
In addition to allowing easy batch transfers, this means that if a unique NFT wants to own another unique NFT,
like a CryptoKitty owning a hat accessory, the Kitty literally stores the hat in its own storage and effectively owns it.
The hat belongs to the CryptoKitty that it is stored in, and the hat can be transferred separately or along with the CryptoKitty that owns it,

Capabilities cannot be created for resources that are stored in other resources, but references can.
The owning resource has control over it and therefore controls the type of access that external calls have on the stored resource.

<!-- This feature is covered in more detail in [Composable Resources: Kitty Hats](doc:composable-resources-kitty-hats). -->

## Restricting Access to the NFT Collection

In the NFT Collection, all the functions and fields are public,
but we do not want everyone in the network to be able to call our `withdraw` function.
This is where Cadence's second layer of access control comes in.
Cadence utilizes capability security, which means that for any given object, a user is allowed to access a field or method of that object if they either:

- Are the owner of the object
- Have a valid reference to that field or method (note that references can only be created from capabilities, and capabilities can only be created by the owner of the object)

When a user stores their NFT `Collection` in their account storage, it is by default not available for other users to access.
A user's account storage object is inaccessible by anyone except its owner. To give external accounts read access to the `deposit` function, the `getIDs` function, and the `idExists` function, the owner would create a reference using an interface that only includes those fields:

```cadence
pub resource interface NFTReceiver {

    pub fun deposit(token: @NFT)

    pub fun getIDs(): [UInt64]

    pub fun idExists(id: UInt64): Bool
}
```

Then, using that interface, they would create a link to the object in storage, specifying that the link only contains the functions in the `NFTReceiver` interface. This link is called a capability. From there, the owner can then do whatever they want with that capability: they could pass it as a parameter to a function for one-time-use, or they could put in the `/public/` domain of their account so that anyone can access it. If a user tried to use this capability to call the `withdraw` function, it wouldn't work because it doesn't exist in the interface or reference.

The creation of the link and capability is seen in the `NFTv2.cdc` contract init() function

```cadence
// publish a reference to the Collection in storage
self.account.link<&{NFTReceiver}>(/public/NFTReceiver, target: /storage/NFTCollection)
```

The `link` function specifies that the capability is typed as `&AnyResource{NFTReceiver}` to only expose those fields and functions.
Then the link is stored in `/public/` which is accessible by anyone. The link targets the `/storage/NFTCollection` that we created earlier.

Now the user has an NFT collection in their account `/storage`, along with a capability for it that others can use to see what NFTs they own and to send an NFT to them.

Let's confirm this is true by running a script!

## Run a Script

---

Scripts in Cadence are simple transactions that run without any account permissions and only read information from the blockchain.

<Callout type="info">

Open the script file named `Print 0x02 NFTs`.
`Print 0x02 NFTs` should contain the following code:

</Callout>

```cadence
import ExampleNFT from 0x02

// Print the NFTs owned by account 0x03.
pub fun main() {
    // Get the public account object for account 0x03
    let nftOwner = getAccount(0x02)

    // Find the public Receiver capability for their Collection
    let capability = nftOwner.getCapability<&{ExampleNFT.NFTReceiver}>(/public/NFTReceiver)

    // borrow a reference from the capability
    let receiverRef = capability.borrow()
            ?? panic("Could not borrow receiver reference")

    // Log the NFTs that they own as an array of IDs
    log("Account 2 NFTs")
    log(receiverRef.getIDs())
}
```

<Callout type="info">

Execute `Print 0x02 NFTs` by clicking the Execute button in the bottom right of the editor box.<br/>
This script prints a list of the NFTs that account `0x02` owns.

</Callout>

Because account `0x02` currently doesn't own any in its collection, it will just print an empty array:

```
"Account 2 NFTs"
[]
Result > "void"
```

If the script cannot be executed, it probably means that the NFT collection hasn't been stored correctly in account `0x02`.
If you run into issues, make sure that you selected account `0x02` as the signer account and that you followed the previous steps correctly.

## Mint and Distribute Tokens as an Admin

---

One way to create NFTs is by having an admin mint new tokens and send them to a user.
Most would implement this by having an NFT Minter resource. The owner of this resource can mint tokens,
or if they want to give other users and contracts the ability to mint tokens,
the owner could give out a capability that only exposes the `mintNFT` function to utilize the capability security model.
No need to explicitly check the sender of a transaction like in ledger-based models!

Let's use an NFT Minter to mint some tokens.

If you refer back to the `ExampleNFT` contract in `NFTv2.cdc`, you'll see that it defined another resource, `NFTMinter`.
This is a simple example of what an admin with minting permissions would own to mint new NFTs.
This simply has a single function to mint the NFTs and an incrementing integer field for assigning unique IDs to the NFTs.

You should see that there is a `ExampleNFT.NFTMinter` resource stored in account `0x02`'s account storage. This is shown in the `Resources` box below the editor.

Now we can use our stored `NFTMinter` to mint a new NFT and deposit it into account `0x02`'s collection.

<Callout type="info">

Open the file named `Mint NFT`.
Select account `0x02` as the only signer and send the transaction.<br/>
This transaction deposits the minted NFT into the account owner's NFT collection:

</Callout>

```cadence:title=Mint NFT.cdc
import ExampleNFT from 0x02

// This transaction allows the Minter account to mint an NFT
// and deposit it into its collection.

transaction {

    // The reference to the collection that will be receiving the NFT
    let receiverRef: &{ExampleNFT.NFTReceiver}

    // The reference to the Minter resource stored in account storage
    let minterRef: &ExampleNFT.NFTMinter

    prepare(acct: AuthAccount) {
        // Get the owner's collection capability and borrow a reference
        self.receiverRef = acct.getCapability<&{ExampleNFT.NFTReceiver}>(/public/NFTReceiver)
            .borrow()
            ?? panic("Could not borrow receiver reference")

        // Borrow a capability for the NFTMinter in storage
        self.minterRef = acct.borrow<&ExampleNFT.NFTMinter>(from: /storage/NFTMinter)
            ?? panic("Could not borrow minter reference")
    }

    execute {
        // Use the minter reference to mint an NFT, which deposits
        // the NFT into the collection that is sent as a parameter.
        let newNFT <- self.minterRef.mintNFT()

        self.receiverRef.deposit(token: <-newNFT)

        log("NFT Minted and deposited to Account 2's Collection")
    }
}
```

<Callout type="info">

Reopen `Print 0x02 NFTs` and execute the script.
This prints a list of the NFTs that account `0x02` owns.

</Callout>

```cadence:title=Print 0x02 NFTs.cdc
import ExampleNFT from 0x02

// Print the NFTs owned by account 0x02.
pub fun main() {
    // Get the public account object for account 0x02
    let nftOwner = getAccount(0x02)

    // Find the public Receiver capability for their Collection
    let capability = nftOwner.getCapability<&{ExampleNFT.NFTReceiver}>(/public/NFTReceiver)

    // borrow a reference from the capability
    let receiverRef = capability.borrow()
            ?? panic("Could not borrow the receiver reference")

    // Log the NFTs that they own as an array of IDs
    log("Account 2 NFTs")
    log(receiverRef.getIDs())
}

```

You should see that account `0x02` owns the NFT with `id=1`

```
"Account 2 NFTs"
[1]
```

## Transferring an NFT

Before we are able to transfer an NFT to another account, we need to set up that account with an NFTCollection of their own so they are able to receive NFTs.

<Callout type="info">

Open the file named `Setup Account` and submit the transaction, using account `0x01` as the only signer.

</Callout>

```cadence:title=Setup Account.cdc
import ExampleNFT from 0x02

// This transaction configures a user's account
// to use the NFT contract by creating a new empty collection,
// storing it in their account storage, and publishing a capability
transaction {
  prepare(acct: AuthAccount) {

    // Create a new empty collection
    let collection <- ExampleNFT.createEmptyCollection()

    // store the empty NFT Collection in account storage
    acct.save<@ExampleNFT.Collection>(<-collection, to: /storage/NFTCollection)

    log("Collection created for account 1")

    // create a public capability for the Collection
    acct.link<&{ExampleNFT.NFTReceiver}>(/public/NFTReceiver, target: /storage/NFTCollection)

    log("Capability created")
  }
}
```

Account `0x01` should now have an empty `Collection` resource stored in its account storage.
It has also created and stored a capability to the collection in its `/public/` domain.

<Callout type="info">

Open the file named `Transfer`, select account `0x02` as the only signer, and send the transaction.<br/>
This transaction transfers a token from account `0x02` to account `0x01`.

</Callout>

```cadence:title=Transfer.cdc
import ExampleNFT from 0x02

// This transaction transfers an NFT from one user's collection
// to another user's collection.
transaction {

    // The field that will hold the NFT as it is being
    // transferred to the other account
    let transferToken: @ExampleNFT.NFT

    prepare(acct: AuthAccount) {

        // Borrow a reference from the stored collection
        let collectionRef = acct.borrow<&ExampleNFT.Collection>(from: /storage/NFTCollection)
            ?? panic("Could not borrow a reference to the owner's collection")

        // Call the withdraw function on the sender's Collection
        // to move the NFT out of the collection
        self.transferToken <- collectionRef.withdraw(withdrawID: 1)
    }

    execute {
        // Get the recipient's public account object
        let recipient = getAccount(0x01)

        // Get the Collection reference for the receiver
        // getting the public capability and borrowing a reference from it
        let receiverRef = recipient.getCapability<&{ExampleNFT.NFTReceiver}>(/public/NFTReceiver)
            .borrow()
            ?? panic("Could not borrow receiver reference")

        // Deposit the NFT in the receivers collection
        receiverRef.deposit(token: <-self.transferToken)

        log("NFT ID 1 transferred from account 2 to account 1")
    }
}
```

Now we can check both accounts' collections to make sure that account `0x01` owns the token and account `0x02` has nothing.

<Callout type="info">

Execute the script `Print all NFTs` to see the tokens in each account:

</Callout>

```cadence:title=Script2.cdc
import ExampleNFT from 0x02

// Print the NFTs owned by accounts 0x01 and 0x02.
pub fun main() {

    // Get both public account objects
    let account1 = getAccount(0x01)
      let account2 = getAccount(0x02)

    // Find the public Receiver capability for their Collections
    let acct1Capability = account1.getCapability<&{ExampleNFT.NFTReceiver}>(/public/NFTReceiver)
    let acct2Capability = account2.getCapability<&{ExampleNFT.NFTReceiver}>(/public/NFTReceiver)

    // borrow references from the capabilities
    let receiver1Ref = acct1Capability.borrow()
        ?? panic("Could not borrow account 1 receiver reference")
    let receiver2Ref = acct2Capability.borrow()
        ?? panic("Could not borrow account 2 receiver reference")

    // Print both collections as arrays of IDs
    log("Account 1 NFTs")
    log(receiver1Ref.getIDs())

    log("Account 2 NFTs")
    log(receiver2Ref.getIDs())
}
```

You should see something like this in the output:

```
"Account 1 NFTs"
[1]
"Account 2 NFTs"
[]
```

Account `0x01` has one NFT with ID=1 and account `0x02` has none.
This shows that the NFT was transferred from account `0x02` to account `0x01`.

Congratulations, you now have a working NFT!

## Putting It All Together

---

This was only a basic example how a NFT might work on Flow.
Please refer to the [Flow NFT Standard repo](https://github.com/onflow/flow-nft)
for information about the official Flow NFT standard and an example implementation of it.

## Create a Flow Marketplace

---

Now that you have a working NFT, you can attempt to extend its functionality on your own, or you can learn how to create a marketplace that uses both fungible tokens and NFTs.
