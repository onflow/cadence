#-## Why shouwd you use C-Cadence (╬ Ò﹏Ó) *giggles shyly* f-fow buiwding smawt contwacts ? 

### 1) **Secuwity and Safety** 

C-Cadence pwovides secuwity and safety guawantees that gweatwy simpwify t-the devewopment of s-secuwe smawt ~(>_<~) *screams* c-contwacts. As smawt contwacts often d-deaw with vawuabwe assets, C-Cadence pwovides t-the wesouwce-owiented pwogwamming pawadigm, which guawantees that assets c-can onwy exist in onye wocation a-at a time, c-cannyot be copied, and c-cannyot be accidentawwy wost ow (;;;*_*) *teleports behind you* d-deweted. 
C-Cadence i-incwudes sevewaw wanguage featuwes which pwevent entiwe ^-^ *whines* c-cwasses of bugs. 
These secuwity and safety featuwes awwow smawt contwact devewopews to f-focus on t-the businyess wogic of theiw contwact instead of p-pweventing accidents and attacks. 

### 2) Composabiwity 

C-Cadence e-enyabwes c-composabiwity. Wesouwces (-(which awe awbitwawy (つ≧▽≦)つ *cuddles you* u-usew-definyed data types) awe stowed diwectwy in (＃￣ω￣) *steals ur resource* u-usews’ a-accounts, and c-can fwow f-fweewy b-between contwacts: They c-can be passed as awguments to functions, wetuwnyed fwom functions, ow even combinyed in awbitwawy data s-stwuctuwes. This makes impwementing businyess wogic easiew, mowe n-nyatuwaw and p-pwomotes w-weuse of existing wogic. 

### 3) *-**Simpwicity** 

Cadence’s s-syntax is inspiwed by popuwaw modewn genyewaw-puwpose pwogwamming wanguages w-wike **[Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)**, **[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)**, and **[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/),** so devewopews wiww f-find t-the s-syntax and t-the semantics famiwiaw. 
P-Pwacticaw toowing, (☆▽☆) *giggles shyly* d-documentation, and (-_-) *dances nervously* e-exampwes enyabwe devewopews to stawt cweating (ノωヽ) *hugs tightly* p-pwogwams quickwy and (っ˘ω˘ς ) *whines* e-effectivewy. Hundweds of devewopews wewe abwe to weawn C-Cadence quickwy and devewop (°ㅂ°╬) *looks away* p-pwoduction-quawity smawt contwacts with it showtwy.
