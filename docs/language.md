# Bamboo Programming Language

## Table of Contents

## Introduction

The Bamboo Programming Language is a new high-level programming language intended for smart contract development.

The language's goals are, in order of importance:

- **Safety and security**: Provide a strong static type system, design by contract (preconditions and postconditions), and resources (inspired by linear types).
- **Auditability**: Focus on readability: make it easy to verify what the code is doing, and make intentions explicit, at a small cost of verbosity.
- **Simplicity**: Focus on developer productivity and usability: make it easy to write code, provide good tooling.

## Terminology

In this document, the following terminology is used to describe syntax or behavior that is not allowed in the language:

- `Invalid` means that the invalid program will not even be allowed to run.
  The program error is detected and reported statically by the type checker.

- `Run-time error` means that the erroneous program will run,
  but bad behavior will result in the execution of the program being aborted.

## Syntax and Behavior

Much of the language's syntax is inspired by Swift, Kotlin, and TypeScript.

Much of the syntax, types, and standard library is inspired by Swift,
which popularized e.g. optionals, argument labels,
and provides safe handling of integers and strings.

Resources are based on liner types which were popularized by Rust.

Events are inspired by Solidity.

## Comments

Comments can be used to document code.
A comment is text that is not executed.

*Single-line comments* start with two slashes (`//`).
These comments can go on a line by themselves or they can go directly after a line of code.

```bamboo,file=single-line-comment.bpl
// This is a comment on a single line.
// Another comment line that is not executed.

let x = 1  // Here is another comment after a line of code.
```

*Multi-line comments* start with a slash and an asterisk (`/*`)
and end with an asterisk and a slash (`*/`):

```bamboo,file=multi-line-comment.bpl
/* This is a comment which
spans multiple lines. */
```

Comments may be nested.

```bamboo,file=nested-comment.bpl
/* /* this */ is a valid comment */
```

Mutli-line comments are balanced.

```bamboo,file=invalid-nested-comment.bpl
/* this is a // comment up to here */ this is not part of the comment */
```

## Constants and Variable Declarations

Constants and variables are declarations that bind a value to a name.
Constants can only be initialized with a value and cannot be reassigned afterwards.
Variables can be initialized with a value and can be reassigned later.
Declarations are valid in any scope, including the global scope.

Constant means that the *name* is constant, not the *value* –
the value may still be changed if it allows it, i.e. is mutable.

Constants are declared using the `let` keyword. Variables are declared using the `var` keyword.
The keywords are followed by the name, an optional [type annotation](#type-annotations), an equals sign `=`, and the initial value.

```bamboo,file=constants-and-variables.bpl
// Declare a constant named `a`.
//
let a = 1

// Invalid: re-assigning to a constant.
//
a = 2

// Declare a variable named `b`.
//
var b = 3

// Assign a new value to the variable named `b`.
//
b = 4
```

Variables and constants **must** be initialized.

```bamboo
// Invalid: the constant has no initial value.
//
let a
```

Once a constant or variable is declared,
it cannot be redeclared with the same name,
with a different type,
or changed into the corresponding other kind (variable to a constant and vice versa) in the same scope.

```bamboo
// Declare a constant named `a`.
//
let a = 1

// Invalid: cannot re-declare a constant with name `a`,
// as it is already used in this scope.
//
let a = 2

// Declare a variable named `b`.
//
var b = 3

// Invalid: cannot re-declare a variable with name `b`,
// as it is already used in this scope.
//
var b = 4

// Invalid: cannot declare a variable with the name `a`,
// as it is already used in this scope,
// and it is declared as a constant.
//
var a = 5
```

However, variables can be redeclared in sub-scopes.

```bamboo
// Declare a constant named `a`.
//
let a = 1

if true {
    // Declare a constant with the same name `a`.
    // This is valid because it is in a sub-scope.
    // This variable is not visible to the outer scope.

    let a = 2
}

// `a` is `1`
```

A variable cannot be used as its own initial value.

```bamboo
// Invalid: Use of variable in its own initial value.
let a = a
```

## Type Annotations

When declaring a constant or variable, an optional *type annotation* can be provided,
to make it explicit what type the declaration has.

If no type annotation is provided, the type of the declaration is [inferred from the initial value](#type-inference).

```bamboo,file=type-annotations.bpl
// Declare a variable named `boolVarWithAnnotation`, which has an explicit type annotation.
//
// `Bool` is the type of booleans.
//
var boolVarWithAnnotation: Bool = false

// Declare a constant named `integerWithoutAnnotation`, which has no type annotation
// and for which the type is inferred to be `Int`, the type of arbitrary-precision integers.
//
// This is based on the initial value which is an integer literal.
// Integer literals are always inferred to be of type `Int`.
//
let integerWithoutAnnotation = 1

// Declare a constant named `smallIntegerWithAnnotation`, which has an explicit type annotation.
// Because of the explicit type annotation, the type is not inferred.
// This declaration is valid because the integer literal `1` fits into the range of the type `Int8`,
// the type of 8-bit signed integers.
//
let smallIntegerWithAnnotation: Int8 = 1
```

If a type annotation is provided, the initial value must be of this type,
and new values assigned to variables must match the declaration's explicit type
or the type that was inferred when the variable was declared.
This type safety is explained in more detail in a [separate section](#type-safety).

```bamboo
// Invalid: declare a variable with an explicit type `Bool`,
// but the initial value has type `Int`.
//
let booleanConstant: Bool = 1

// Declare a variable that has the inferred type `Bool`.
//
var booleanVariable = false

// Invalid: assign a value with type `Int` to a variable which has the inferred type `Bool`.
//
booleanVariable = 1
```

## Naming

Names may start with any upper or lowercase letter (A-Z, a-z) or an underscore (`_`).
This may be followed by zero or more upper and lower case letters, underscores, and numbers (0-9).
Names may not begin with a number.

```bamboo
// Valid: title-case
//
PersonID

// Valid: with underscore
//
token_name

// Valid: leading underscore and characters
//
_balance

// Valid: leading underscore and numbers
_8264

// Valid: characters and number
//
account2

// Invalid: leading number
//
1something

// Invalid: invalid character #
_#1

// Invalid: various invalid characters
//
!@#$%^&*
```

### Conventions

By convention, variables, constants, and functions have lowercase names;
and types have title-case names.

## Semicolons

Semicolons (;) are used as statement separators.
A semicolon can be placed after any statement,
but can be omitted if only one statement appears on the line.
Semicolons must be used to separate multiple statements if they appear on the same line –
exactly one semicolon between each pair of statements.

```bamboo,file=semicolons.bpl
// Declare a constant, without a semicolon.
//
let a = 1

// Declare a variable, with a semicolon.
//
var b = 2;

// Declare a constant and a variable on a single line, separated by semicolons.
//
let d = 1; var e = 2

// Invalid: Multiple semicolons between statements.
let f = 1;; let g = 2
```

## Values and Types

Values are objects, like for example booleans, integers, or arrays.
Values are typed.

### Booleans

The two boolean values `true` and `false` have the type `Bool`.

### Numeric Literals

Numbers can be written in various bases. Numbers are assumed to be decimal by default.
Non-decimal literals have a specific prefix.

| Numeral system  | Prefix | Characters                                                            |
|:----------------|:-------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Decimal**     | *None* | one or more numbers (`0` to `9`)                                      |
| **Binary**      | `0b`   | one or more zeros or ones (`0` or `1`)                                |
| **Octal**       | `0o`   | one or more numbers in the range `0` to `7`                           |
| **Hexadecimal** | `0x`   | one or more numbers, or characters `a` to `f`, lowercase or uppercase |

```bamboo,file=numbers.bpl
// A decimal number
//
1234567890  // is `1234567890`

// A binary number
//
0b101010  // is `42`

// An octal number
//
0o12345670  // is `2739128`

// A hexadecimal number
//
0x1234567890ABCabc  // is `1311768467294898876`

// Invalid: unsupported prefix 0z
//
0z0

// A decimal number with leading zeros. Not an octal number!
00123 // is `123`

// A binary number with several trailing zeros.
0b001000  // is `8`
```

Decimal numbers may contain underscores (`_`) to logically separate components.

```bamboo,file=number-underscores-decimal.bpl
let largeNumber = 1_000_000

// Invalid: Value is not a number literal, but a variable.
let notNumber = _123
```

Underscores are allowed for all numeral systems.

```bamboo,file=number-underscores-binary.bpl
let binaryNumber = 0b10_11_01
```

### Integers

Integers are whole numbers without a fractional part.
They are either *signed* (positive, zero, or negative) or *unsigned* (positive or zero)
and are either 8 bits, 16 bits, 32 bits, 64 bits or arbitrarily large.

The names for the integer types follow this naming convention:
Signed integer types have an `Int` prefix, unsigned integer types have a `UInt` prefix,
i.e., the integer types are named `Int8`, `Int16`, `Int32`, `Int64`, `UInt8`, `UInt16`, `UInt32`, and `UInt64`.
The types are independent types, i.e. not subtypes of each other.

- **`Int8`**: -128 through 127
- **`Int16`**: -32768 through 32767
- **`Int32`**: -2147483648 through 2147483647
- **`Int64`**: -9223372036854775808 through 9223372036854775807
- **`UInt16`**: 0 through 65535
- **`UInt32`**: 0 through 4294967295
- **`UInt64`**: 0 through 18446744073709551615

```bamboo
// Declare a constant that has type `UInt8` and the value 10.
let smallNumber: UInt8 = 10
```

```bamboo
// Invalid: negative literal cannot be used as an unsigned integer
//
let invalidNumber: UInt8 = -10
```

In addition, the arbitrary precision integer type `Int` is provided.

```bamboo
let veryLargeNumber: Int = 10000000000000000000000000000000
```

Integer literals are [inferred](#type-inference) to have type `Int`,
or if the literal occurrs in a position that expects an explicit type,
e.g. in a variable declaration with an explicit type annotation.

```bamboo
let someNumber = 123

// `someNumber` has type `Int`
```

Negative integers are encoded in two's complement representation.

Integer types are not converted automatically. Types most be explicitly converted,
which can be done by calling the constructor of the type with the integer type.

```bamboo
let x: Int8 = 1
let y: Int16 = 2

// Invalid: the types of the operands, `Int8` and `Int16` are incompatible.
let z = x + y

// Explicitly convert `x` from `Int8` to `Int16`.
let a = Int16(x) + y

// `a` has type `Int16`

// Invalid: The integer literal is expected to be of type `UInt8`,
// but the large integer literal does not fit in the range of `UInt8`.
//
let b = x + 1000000000000000000000000
```

### Floating-Point Numbers

There is **no** support for floating point numbers.

Smart Contracts are not intended to work with values with error margins
and therefore floating point arithmetic is not appropriate here.
Fixed point numbers should be simulated using integers and a scale factor for now.

### Addresses

The type `Address` represents an address.
Addresses are unsigned integers with a size of 160 bits (20 bytes).
Hexadecimal integer literals can be used to create address values.

```bamboo
// Declare a constant that has type `Address`.
//
let someAddress: Address = 0x06012c8cf97bead5deae237070f9587f8e7a266d

// Invalid: Initial value is not compatible with type `Address`,
// it is not a number.
//
let notAnAddress: Address = ""

// Invalid: Initial value is not compatible with type `Address`.
// The integer literal is valid, however, it is larger than 160 bits.
//
let alsoNotAnAddress: Address = 0x06012c8cf97bead5deae237070f9587f8e7a266d123456789
```

Integer literals are not inferred to be an address.

```bamboo
// Declare a number. Even though it happens to be a valid address,
// it is not inferred as it.
//
let aNumber = 0x06012c8cf97bead5deae237070f9587f8e7a266d
// `aNumber` has type `Int`
```

### Any

`Any` is the top type, i.e., all types are a subtype of it.

```bamboo
// Declare a variable that has the type `Any`.
// Any value can be assigned to it, for example an integer.
//
var someValue: Any = 1

// Assign a value with a different type, `Bool`.
someValue = true
```

However, using `Any` does not opt-out of type checking.
It is invalid to access fields and call functions on `Any` typed values,
as it has no fields and functions.

```bamboo
// Declare a variable that has the type `Any`. The initial value is an integer,
// but the variable  still has the explicit type `Any`.
//
let a: Any = 1

// Invalid: Operator cannot be used for an `Any` value (`a`, left-hand side)
// and an `Int` value (`2`, right-hand side).
//
a + 2
```

`Any` may be used like any other type, for example, it may be the element type of [arrays](#arrays)
or be the element type of an [optional type](#optionals).

```bamboo
// Declare a variable that has the type `[Any]`, i.e. an array of elements of any type.
//
let anyValues: [Any] = [1, "2", true]

// Declare a variable that has the type `Any?`, i.e. an optional type of any type.
//
var maybeSomething: Any? = 42

maybeSomething = "twenty-four"

maybeSomething = nil
```

`Any` is also the super-type of optional types.

```bamboo
let maybeInt: Int? = 1
let anything: Any = y
```

### Optionals

Optionals are values which can represent the absence of a value. Optionals have two cases:
either there is a value, or there is nothing.

An optional type is declared using the `?` suffix for another type.
For example, `Int` is a non-optional integer, and `Int?` is an optional integer,
i.e. either nothing, or an integer.

The value representing nothing is `nil`.

```bamboo,file=optional.bpl
// Declare a constant which has an optional integer type,
// with nil as its initial value.
//
let a: Int? = nil

// Declare a constant which has an optional integer type,
// with 42 as its initial value.
//
let b: Int? = 42

// Invalid: `b` has type `Int?`, which does not support arithmetic.
b + 23

// Invalid: Declare a constant with a non-optional integer type `Int`,
// but the initial value is `nil`, which in this context has type `Int?`.
//
let x: Int = nil
```

Optionals can be created for any value, not just for literals.

```bamboo,file=optional-wrapping.bpl
// Declare a constant which has a non-optional integer type,
// with 1 as its initial value.
//
let x = 1

// Declare a constant which has an optional integer type.
// An optional with the value of `x` is created.
//
let y: Int? = x

// Declare a variable which has an optional any type, i.e. the variable
// may be `nil`, or any other value.
// An optional with the value of `x` is created.
//
var z: Any? = x
```

A non-optional type is a subtype of its optional type.

```bamboo
var a: Int? = nil
let b = 2
a = b

// `a` is `2`
```

Optional types may be contained in other types, for example [arrays](#arrays) or even optionals.

```bamboo
// Declare a constant which has an array type of optional integers.
let xs: [Int?] = [1, nil, 2, nil]

// Declare a constant which has a double optional type.
//
let doubleOptional: Int?? = nil
```

#### Nil-Coalescing Operator

The nil-coalescing operator `??` returns the value inside an optional if it contains a value,
or returns an alternative value if the optional has no value, i.e., the optional value is `nil`.

If the left-hand side is non-nil, the right-hand side is not evaluated.

```bamboo
// Declare a constant which has an optional integer type
//
let a: Int? = nil

// Declare a constant with a non-optional integer type,
// which is initialized to `a` if it is non-nil, or 42 otherwise.
//
let b: Int = a ?? 42
// `b` is 42, as `a` is nil
```

The nil-coalescing operator can only be applied to values which have an optional type.

```bamboo
// Declare a constant with a non-optional integer type.
//
let a = 1

// Invalid: nil-coalescing operator is applied to a value which has a non-optional type
// (a has the non-optional type `Int`).
//
let b = a ?? 2
```

```bamboo
// Invalid: nil-coalescing operator is applied to a value which has a non-optional type
// (the integer literal is of type `Int`).
//
let c = 1 ?? 2
```

The type of the right-hand side of the operator (the alternative value) must be a subtype
of the type of the left-hand side, i.e. the right-hand side of the operator must
be the non-optional or optional type matching the type of the left-hand side.

```bamboo
// Declare a constant with an optional integer type.
//
let a: Int? = nil
let b: Int? = 1
let c = a ?? b
// `c` is `1` and has type `Int?`

// Invalid: nil-coalescing operator is applied to a value of type `Int?`,
// but the alternative has type `Bool`.
//
let d = a ?? false
```

#### Conditional Downcasting Operator

> 🚧 Status: The conditional downcasting operator `as?` is implemented,
> but it only supports values that have the type `Any`.

The conditional downcasting operator `as?` can be used to type cast a value to a type.
The operator returns an optional.
If the value has a type that is a subtype of the given type that should be casted to,
the operator returns the value as the given type,
otherwise the result is `nil`.

The cast and check is performed at run-time, i.e. when the program is executed,
not statically, i.e. when the program is checked.

```bamboo,file=conditional-downcasting-any.bpl
// Declare a constant named `something` which has type `Any`,
// with an initial value which has type `Int`.
//
let something: Any = 1

// Conditionally downcast the value of `something` to `Int`.
// The cast succeeds, because the value has type `Int`.
//
let number = something as? Int
// `number` is `1` and has type `Int?`

// Conditionally downcast the value of `something` to `Bool`.
// The cast fails, because the value has type `Int`,
// and `Bool` is not a subtype of `Int`.
//
let boolean = something as? Bool
// `boolean` is `nil` and has type `Bool?`
```

Downcasting works for nested types (e.g. arrays),
interfaces (if a [resource](#resources) interface not to a concrete resource),
and optionals.

```bamboo,file=conditional-downcasting-any-array.bpl
// Declare a constant named `values` which has type `[Any]`,
// i.e. an array of arbitrarily typed values.
//
let values: [Any] = [1, true]

let first = values[0] as? Int
// `first` is `1` and has type `Int?`

let second = values[1] as? Bool
// `second` is `true` and has type `Bool?`
```

### Never

`Never` is the bottom type, i.e., it is a subtype of all types.
There is no value that has type `Never`.
`Never` can be used as the return type for functions that never return normally.
For example, it is the return type of the function [`panic`](#panic).

```bamboo
// Declare a function named `crashAndBurn` which will never return,
// because it calls the function named `panic`, which never returns.
//
fun crashAndBurn(): Never {
    panic("An unrecoverable error occurred")
}

// Invalid: Declare a constant with a `Never` type, but the initial value is an integer.
//
let x: Never = 1

// Invalid: Declare a function which returns an invalid return value `nil`,
// which is not a value of type `Never`.
//
fun returnNever(): Never {
    return nil
}
```

### Strings and Characters

> 🚧 Status: Characters are not implemented yet.

Strings are collections of characters.
Strings have the type `String`, and characters have the type `Character`.
Strings can be used to work with text in a Unicode-compliant way.
Strings are immutable.

String and character literals are enclosed in double quotation marks (`"`).

```bamboo
let someString = "Hello, world!"
```

String literals may contain escape sequences. An escape sequence starts with a backslash (`\`):

- `\0`: Null character
- `\\`: Backslash
- `\t`: Horizontal tab
- `\n`: Line feed
- `\r`: Carriage return
- `\"`: Double quotation mark
- `\'`: Single quotation mark
- `\u`: A Unicode scalar value, written as `\u{x}`,
  where `x` is a 1–8 digit hexadecimal number which needs to be a valid Unicode scalar value,
  i.e., in the range 0 to 0xD7FF and 0xE000 to 0x10FFFF inclusive

```bamboo
// Declare a constant which contains two lines of text
// (separated by the line feed character `\n`), and ends
// with a thumbs up emoji, which has code point U+1F44D (0x1F44D).
//
let thumbsUpText =
    "This is the first line.\nThis is the second line with an emoji: \u{1F44D}"
```

The type `Character` represents a single, human-readable character. Characters are extended grapheme clusters, which consist of one or more Unicode scalars.

For example, the single character `ü` can be represented in several ways in Unicode.
First, it can be represented by a single Unicode scalar value `ü`
("LATIN SMALL LETTER U WITH DIAERESIS", code point U+00FC).
Second, the same single character can be represented by two Unicode scalar values:
`u` ("LATIN SMALL LETTER U", code point U+0075),
and "COMBINING DIAERESIS" (code point U+0308).
The combining Unicode scalar value is applied to the scalar before it,
which turns a `u` into a `ü`.

Still, both variants represent the same human-readable character `ü`.

```bamboo
let singleScalar: Character = "\u{FC}"
// `singleScalar` is `ü`
let twoScalars: Character = "\u{75}\u{308}"
// `twoScalars` is `ü`
```

Another example where multiple Unicode scalar values are rendered as a single,
human-readable character is a flag emoji.
These emojis consist of two "REGIONAL INDICATOR SYMBOL LETTER" Unicode scalar values.

```bamboo
// Declare a constant for a string with a single character, the emoji
// for the Canadian flag, which consists of two Unicode scalar values:
// - REGIONAL INDICATOR SYMBOL LETTER C (U+1F1E8)
// - REGIONAL INDICATOR SYMBOL LETTER A (U+1F1E6)
//
let canadianFlag: Character = "\u{1F1E8}\u{1F1E6}"
// `canadianFlag` is `🇨🇦`
```

#### String Fields and Functions

Strings have multiple built-in functions you can use.

- `length: Int`: Returns the number of characters in the string as an integer.

    ```bamboo,file=string-length-field.bpl
    let example = "hello"

    // Find the number of elements of the string.
    let length = example.length
    // `length` is `5`
    ```

- `concat(_ other: String): String`:
  Concatenates the string `other` to the end of the original string,
  but does not modify the original string.
  This function creates a new string whose length is the sum of the lengths
  of the string the function is called on and the string given as a parameter.

    ```bamboo,file=string-concat.bpl
    let example = "hello"
    let new = "world"

    // Concatenate the new string onto the example string and return the new string.
    let helloWorld = example.concat(new)
    // `helloWorld` is now `"helloworld"`
    ```

- `slice(from: Int, upTo: Int): String`:
  Returns a string slice of the characters in the given string from start index `from` up to,
  but not including, the end index `upTo`.
  This function creates a new string whose length is `upto - from`.
  It does not modify the original string.
  If either of the parameters are out of the bounds of the string, the function will fail.

    ```bamboo,file=string-slice.bpl
    let example = "helloworld"

    // Create a new slice of part of the original string.
    let slice = example.slice(from: 3, upTo: 6)
    // `slice` is now `"lowo"`

    // Run-time error: Out of bounds index, the program aborts.
    let outOfBounds = example.slice(from: 2, upTo: 10)
    ```

<!--

#### String Functions

- Document and link to string concatenation operator `&` in operators section

-->

### Arrays

Arrays are mutable, ordered collections of values.
All values in an array must have the same type.
Arrays may contain a value multiple times.
Array literals start with an opening square bracket `[` and end with a closing square bracket `]`.

```bamboo,file=arrays.bpl
// An empty array
//
[]

// An array with integers
//
[1, 2, 3]

// Invalid: mixed types
//
[1, true, 2, false]
```

#### Array Types

Arrays either have a fixed size or are variably sized, i.e., elements can be added and removed.

Fixed-size arrays have the form `[T; N]`, where `T` is the element type,
and `N` is the size of the array.
For example, a fixed-size array of 3 `Int8` elements has the type `[Int8; 3]`.

Variable-size arrays have the form `[T]`, where `T` is the element type.
For example, the type `[Int16]` specifies a variable-size array of elements that have type `Int16`.

It is important to understand that arrays are value types and are only ever copied
when used as an initial value for a constant or variable,
when assigning to a variable,
when used as function argument,
or when returned from a function call.

```bamboo,file=array-types.bpl
// Declare a fixed-sized array of integers
// which always contains exactly two elements.
//
let array: [Int8; 2] = [1, 2]

// Declare a fixed-sized array of fixed-sized arrays of integers.
// The inner arrays always contain exactly three elements,
// the outer array always contains two elements.
//
let arrays: [[Int16; 3]; 2] = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6]
]
```

Array types are covariant in their element types.
For example, `[Int]` is a subtype of `[Any]`.
This is safe because arrays are value types and not reference types.

#### Array Indexing

To get the element of an array at a specific index, the indexing syntax can be used:
The array is followed by an opening square bracket `[`, the indexing value, and ends with a closing square bracket `]`.

Indexes start at 0 for the first element in the array.

Accessing an element which is out of bounds results in a fatal error at run-time and aborts the program.

```bamboo,file=arrays-indexing.bpl
// Declare an array of integers.
let numbers = [42, 23]

// Get the first number of the array.
//
numbers[0] // is `42`

// Get the second number of the array.
//
numbers[1] // is `23`

// Run-time error: Index 2 is out of bounds, the program aborts.
//
numbers[2]
```

```bamboo,file=arrays-nested-indexing.bpl
// Declare an array of arrays of integers, i.e. the type is `[[Int]]`.
let arrays = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]

// Get the first number of the second array.
//
arrays[1][0] // is `3`
```

To set an element of an array at a specific index, the indexing syntax can be used as well.

```bamboo,file=array-indexing-assignment.bpl
// Declare an array of integers.
let numbers = [42, 23]

// Change the second number in the array.
//
// NOTE: The declaration `numbers` is constant, which means that
// the *name* is constant, not the *value* – the value, i.e. the array,
// is mutable and can be changed.
//
numbers[1] = 2

// `numbers` is `[42, 2]`
```

#### Array Fields and Functions

Arrays have multiple built-in fields and functions
that can be used to get information about and manipulate the contents of the array.

The field `length`, and the functions `concat`, and `contains`
are available for both variable-sized and fixed-sized or variable-sized arrays.

- `length: Int`:
  Returns the number of elements in the array.

    ```bamboo,file=array-length-field.bpl
    // Declare an array of integers.
    let numbers = [42, 23, 31, 12]

    // Find the number of elements of the array.
    let length = numbers.length

    // `length` is `4`
    ```

- `concat(_ array: T): T`:
  Concatenates the parameter `array` to the end of the array the function is called on,
  but does not modify that array.

  Both arrays must be the same type `T`.

  This function creates a new array whose length is the sum of the length of the array
  the function is called on and the length of the array given as the parameter.

    ```bamboo,file=array-concat.bpl
    // Declare two arrays of integers.
    let numbers = [42, 23, 31, 12]
    let moreNumbers = [11, 27]

    // Concatenate the array `moreNumbers` to the array `numbers`
    // and declare a new variable for the result.
    //
    let allNumbers = numbers.concat(moreNumbers)

    // `allNumbers` is `[42, 23, 31, 12, 11, 27]`
    // `numbers` is still `[42, 23, 31, 12]`
    // `moreNumbers` is still `[11, 27]`
    ```

- `contains(_ element: T): Bool`:
  Indicates whether the given element of type `T` is in the array.

    ```bamboo,file=array-contains.bpl
    // Declare an array of integers.
    let numbers = [42, 23, 31, 12]

    // Check if the array contains 11.
    let containsEleven = numbers.contains(11)
    // `containsEleven` is `false`

    // Check if the array contains 12.
    let containsTwelve = numbers.contains(12)
    // `containsTwelve` is `true`

    // Invalid: Check if the array contains the string "Kitty".
    // This results in a type error, as the array only contains integers.
    //
    let containsKitty = numbers.contains("Kitty")
    ```

##### Variable-size Array Functions

The following functions can only be used on variable-sized arrays.
It is invalid to use one of these functions on a fixed-sized array.

- `append(_ element: T): Void`:
  Adds the new element `element` of type `T` to the end of the array.

  The new element must be the same type as all the other elements in the array.

    ```bamboo,file=array-append.bpl
    // Declare an array of integers.
    let numbers = [42, 23, 31, 12]

    // Add a new element to the array.
    numbers.append(20)
    // `numbers` is now `[42, 23, 31, 12, 20]`

    // Invalid: The parameter has the wrong type `String`.
    numbers.append("SneakyString")
    ```

- `insert(at index: Int, _ element: T): Void`:
  Inserts the new element `element` of type `T` at the given `index` of the array.

  The new element must be of the same type as all the other elements in the array.

  The `index` must be within the bounds of the array.
  If the index is outside the bounds, the program aborts.

  The existing element at the supplied index is not overwritten.

  All the elements after the new inserted element are shifted to the right by one.

    ```bamboo,file=array-insert.bpl
    // Declare an array of integers.
    let numbers = [42, 23, 31, 12]

    // Insert a new element at position 1 of the array.
    numbers.insert(at: 1, 20)
    // `numbers` is now `[42, 20, 23, 31, 12]`

    // Run-time error: Out of bounds index, the program aborts.
    numbers.insert(at: 12, 39)
    ```

- `remove(at index: Int): T`:
  Removes the element at the given `index` from the array and returns it.

  The `index` must be within the bounds of the array.
  If the index is outside the bounds, the program aborts.

    ```bamboo,file=array-remove.bpl
    // Declare an array of integers.
    let numbers = [42, 23, 31]

    // Remove element at position 1 of the array.
    let twentyThree = numbers.remove(at: 1)
    // `numbers` is now `[42, 31]`
    // `twentyThree` is `23`

    // Run-time error: Out of bounds index, the program aborts.
    numbers.remove(at: 19)
    ```

- `removeFirst(): T`:
  Removes the first element from the array and returns it.

  The array must not be empty.
  If the array is empty, the program aborts.

    ```bamboo,file=array-remove-first.bpl
    // Declare an array of integers.
    let numbers = [42, 23]

    // Remove the first element of the array.
    let fortytwo = numbers.removeFirst()
    // `numbers` is now `[23]`
    // `fortywo` is `42`

    // Remove the first element of the array.
    let twentyThree = numbers.removeFirst()
    // `numbers` is now `[]`
    // `twentyThree` is `23`

    // Run-time error: The array is empty, the program aborts.
    numbers.removeFirst()
    ```

- `removeLast(): T`:
  Removes the last element from the array and returns it.

  The array must not be empty.
  If the array is empty, the program aborts.

    ```bamboo,file=array-remove.bpl
    // Declare an array of integers.
    let numbers = [42, 23]

    // Remove the last element of the array.
    let twentyThree = numbers.removeLast()
    // `numbers` is now `[42]`
    // `twentyThree` is `23`

    // Remove the last element of the array.
    let fortyTwo = numbers.removeLast()
    // `numbers` is now `[]`
    // `fortyTwo` is `42`

    // Run-time error: The array is empty, the program aborts.
    numbers.removeLast()
    ```

### Dictionaries

Dictionaries are mutable, unordered collections of key-value associations.
In a dictionary, all keys must have the same type, and all values must have the same type.
Dictionaries may contain a key only once and may contain a value multiple times.

Dictionary literals start with an opening brace `{` and end with a closing brace `}`.
Keys are separated from values by a colon, and key-value associations are separated by commas.

```bamboo,file=dictionaries.bpl
// An empty dictionary
//
{}

// A dictionary which associates integers with booleans
//
{
    1: true,
    2: false
}

// Invalid: mixed types
//
{
    1: true,
    false: 2
}
```

#### Dictionary Types

Dictionaries have the form `{K: V}`,
where `K` is the type of the key,
and `V` is the type of the value.
For example, a dictionary with `Int` keys and `Bool` values has type `{Int: Bool}`.

```bamboo,file=dictionary-types.bpl
// Declare a constant that has type `{Int: Bool}`,
// a dictionary mapping integers to booleans.
//
let booleans = {
    1: true,
    0: false
}

// Declare a constant that has type `{Bool: Int}`,
// a dictionary mapping booleans to integers.
//
let integers = {
    true: 1,
    false: 0
}
```

Dictionary types are covariant in their key and value types.
For example, `[Int: String]` is a subtype of `[Any: String]` and also a subtype of `[Int: Any]`.
This is safe because dictionaries are value types and not reference types.

#### Dictionary Access

To get the value for a specific key from a dictionary, the access syntax can be used: The dictionary is followed by an opening square bracket `[`, the key, and ends with a closing square bracket `]`.

Accessing a key returns an [optional](#optionals):
If the key is found in the dictionary, the value for the given key is returned,
and if the key is not found, `nil` is returned.

```bamboo,file=dictionary-access-integer-keys.bpl
// Declare a constant that has type `{Bool: Int}`,
// a dictionary mapping integers to booleans.
//
let booleans = {
    1: true,
    0: false
}

// The result of accessing a key has type `Bool?`.
//
booleans[1]  // is `true`
booleans[0]  // is `false`
booleans[2]  // is `nil`

// Invalid: Accessing a key which does not have type `Int`.
//
booleans["1"]
```

```bamboo,file=dictionary-access-boolean-keys.bpl
// Declare a constant that has type `{Bool: Int}`,
// a dictionary mapping booleans to integers.
//
let integers = {
    true: 1,
    false: 0
}

// The result of accessing a key has type `Int?`
//
integers[true] // is `1`
integers[false] // is `0`
```

To set the value for a key of a dictionary, the access syntax can be used as well.

```bamboo,file=dictionary-assignment.bpl
// Declare a constant that has type `{Int: Bool}`,
// a dictionary mapping booleans to integers.
//
let booleans = {
    1: true,
    0: false
}

// Assign new values for the keys `1` and `0`.
//
booleans[1] = false
booleans[0] = true
// `booleans` is `{1: false, 0: true}`
```

#### Dictionary Fields and Functions

- `length: Int`:
  Returns the number of entries in the dictionary.

    ```bamboo,file=dictionary-length-field.bpl
    // Declare a dictionary mapping strings to integers.
    let numbers = {"fortyTwo": 42, "twentyThree": 23}

    // Find the number of entries of the dictionary.
    let length = numbers.length

    // `length` is `2`
    ```

- `remove(key: K): V?`:
  Removes the value for the given `key` of type `K` from the dictionary.

  Returns the value of type `V` as an optional if the dictionary contained the key,
  otherwise `nil`.

    ```bamboo,file=dictionary-remove.bpl
    // Declare a dictionary mapping strings to integers.
    let numbers = {"fortyTwo": 42, "twentyThree": 23}

    // Remove the key `"fortyTwo"` from the dictionary.
    // The key exists in the dictionary,
    // so the value associated with the key is returned.
    //
    let fortyTwo = numbers.remove(key: "fortyTwo")

    // `fortyTwo` is `42`
    // `numbers` is `{"twentyThree": 23}`

    // Remove the key `"oneHundred"` from the dictionary.
    // The key does not exist in the dictionary, so `nil` is returned.
    //
    let oneHundred = numbers.remove(key: "oneHundred")

    // `oneHundred` is `nil`
    // `numbers` is `{"twentyThree": 23}`
    ```

#### Dictionary Keys

Dictionary keys must be hashable and equatable, i.e., must implement the [`Hashable`](#hashable-interface) and [`Equatable`](#equatable-interface) [interfaces](#interfaces).

Most of the built-in types, like booleans, integers, are hashable and equatable, so can be used as keys in dictionaries.

## Operators

Operators are special symbols that perform a computation for one or more values.
They are either unary, binary, or ternary.

- Unary operators perform an operation for a single value.
  The unary operator symbol appears before the value.

- Binary operators operate on two values.
    The binary operator symbol appears between the two values (infix).

- Ternary operators operate on three values.
  The first operator symbol appears between the first and second value, the second operator symbol appears between the second and third value (infix).

### Negation

The `-` unary operator negates an integer:

```bamboo,file=integer-negation.bpl
let a = 1
-a  // is `-1`
```

The `!` unary operator logically negates a boolean:

```bamboo,file=boolean-negation.bpl
let a = true
!a  // is `false`
```

### Assignment

The binary assignment operator `=` can be used to assign a new value to a variable.
It is only allowed in a statement and is not allowed in expressions.

```bamboo,file=assignment.bpl
var a = 1
a = 2
// `a` is `2`


let b = 3
let c = 4

// Invalid: The assignment operation cannot be used in an expression.
a = b = c

// Instead, the intended assignment must be written in multiple statements.
b = c
a = b
```

The left-hand side of the assignment must be an identifier, followed by one or more index or access expressions.

```bamboo,file=assignment-numbers.bpl
// Declare an array of integers.
let numbers = [1, 2]

// Change the first element of the array.
//
numbers[0] = 3

// `numbers` is `[3, 2]`
```

```bamboo,file=assignment-arrays.bpl
// Declare an array of arrays of integers.
let arrays = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]

// Change the first element in the second array
//
arrays[1][0] = 5

// `arrays` is `[[1, 2], [5, 4]]`
```

```bamboo,file=assignment-dictionaries.bpl
let dictionaries = {
  true: {1: 2},
  false: {3: 4}
}

dictionaries[false][3] = 0

// `dictionaries` is `{
//   true: {1: 2},
//   false: {3: 0}
//}`
```

### Arithmetic

There are four arithmetic operators:

- Addition: `+`
- Subtraction: `-`
- Multiplication: `*`
- Division: `/`
- Remainder: `%`

```bamboo,file=operator-plus.bpl
let a = 1 + 2
// `a` is `3`
```

The arguments for the operators need to be of the same type.
The result is always the same type as the arguments.

Arithmetic operators do not cause values to overflow.

```bamboo,file=operator-times.bpl
let a: Int8 = 100
let b: Int8 = 100
let c = a * b
// `c` is `10000`, and has type `Int`
```

If overflow behavior is intended, overflowing operators are available, which are prefixed with an `&`:

- Overflow addition: `&+`
- Overflow subtraction: `&-`
- Overflow multiplication: `&*`

For example, the maximum value of an unsigned 8-bit integer is 255 (binary 11111111). Adding 1 results in an overflow, truncation to 8 bits, and the value 0.

```bamboo
//     11111111 = 255
// &+         1
//  = 100000000 = 0
```

```bamboo,file=operator-overflow-plus.bpl
let a: UInt8 = 255
a &+ 1 // is `0`
```

Similarly, for the minimum value 0, subtracting 1 wraps around and results in the maximum value 255.

```bamboo,file=operator-minus.bpl
//     00000000
// &-         1
//  =  11111111 = 255
```

```bamboo
let b: UInt8 = 0
b &- 1  // is `255`
```

Signed integers are also affected by overflow. In a signed integer, the first bit is used for the sign. This leaves 7 bits for the actual value for an 8-bit signed integer, i.e., the range of values is -128 (binary 10000000) to 127 (01111111). Subtracting 1 from -128 results in 127.

```bamboo
//    10000000 = -128
// &-        1
//  = 01111111 = 127
```

```bamboo
let c: Int8 = -128
c &- 1  // is `127`
```

Division by zero is a fatal error at run-time and aborts the program.

### Logical Operators

Logical operators work with the boolean values `true` and `false`.

- Logical AND: `a && b`

    ```bamboo,file=operator-and.bpl
    true && true  // is `true`

    true && false  // is `false`

    false && true  // is `false`

    false && false  // is `false`
    ```

    If the left-hand side is false, the right-hand side is not evaluated.

- Logical OR: `a || b`

    ```bamboo,file=operator-or.bpl
    true || true  // is `true`

    true || false  // is `true`

    false || true  // is `true`

    false || false // is `false`
    ```

    If the left-hand side is true, the right-hand side is not evaluated.

### Comparison operators

Comparison operators work with boolean and integer values.

- Equality: `==`, for booleans and integers

    Both sides of the equality operator may be optional, even of different levels,
    so it is for example possible to compare a non-optional with a double-optional (`??`).

    ```bamboo,file=operator-equal-int.bpl
    1 == 1  // is `true`

    1 == 2  // is `false`
    ```

    ```bamboo,file=operator-equal-bool.bpl
    true == true  // is `true`

    true == false  // is `false`
    ```

    ```bamboo,file=operator-equal-optional-int-nil.bpl
    let x: Int? = 1
    x == nil  // is `false`
    ```

    ```bamboo,file=operator-equal-int-nil.bpl
    let x: Int = 1
    x == nil  // is `false`
    ```

    ```bamboo,file=operator-equal-int-nil.bpl
    // Comparisons of different levels of optionals are possible.
    let x: Int? = 2
    let y: Int?? = nil
    x == y  // is `false`
    ```

    ```bamboo,file=operator-equal-optional-int-optionals-int.bpl
    // Comparisons of different levels of optionals are possible.
    let x: Int? = 2
    let y: Int?? = 2
    x == y  // is `true`
    ```

- Inequality: `!=`, for booleans and integers (possibly optional)

    Both sides of the inequality operator may be optional, even of different levels,
    so it is for example possible to compare a non-optional with a double-optional (`??`).

    ```bamboo,file=operator-not-equal-int.bpl
    1 != 1  // is `false`

    1 != 2  // is `true`
    ```

    ```bamboo,file=operator-not-equal-bool.bpl
    true != true  // is `false`

    true != false  // is `true`
    ```

    ```bamboo,file=operator-not-equal-optional-int-nil.bpl
    let x: Int? = 1
    x != nil  // is `true`
    ```

    ```bamboo,file=operator-not-equal-int-nil.bpl
    let x: Int = 1
    x != nil  // is `true`
    ```

    ```bamboo,file=operator-not-equal-int-nil.bpl
    // Comparisons of different levels of optionals are possible.
    let x: Int? = 2
    let y: Int?? = nil
    x != y  // is `true`
    ```

    ```bamboo,file=operator-not-equal-optional-int-optionals-int.bpl
    // Comparisons of different levels of optionals are possible.
    let x: Int? = 2
    let y: Int?? = 2
    x != y  // is `false`
    ```

- Less than: `<`, for integers

    ```bamboo,file=operator-less.bpl
    1 < 1  // is `false`

    1 < 2  // is `true`

    2 < 1  // is `false`
    ```

- Less or equal than: `<=`, for integers

    ```bamboo,file=operator-less-equals.bpl
    1 <= 1  // is `true`

    1 <= 2  // is `true`

    2 <= 1  // is `false`
    ```

- Greater than: `>`, for integers

    ```bamboo,file=operator-greater.bpl
    1 > 1  // is `false`

    1 > 2  // is `false`

    2 > 1  // is `true`
    ```

- Greater or equal than: `>=`, for integers

    ```bamboo,file=operator-greater-equals.bpl
    1 >= 1  // is `true`

    1 >= 2  // is `false`

    2 >= 1  // is `true`
    ```

### Ternary Conditional Operator

There is only one ternary conditional operator, the ternary conditional operator (`a ? b : c`).

It behaves like an if-statement, but is an expression:
If the first operator value is true, the second operator value is returned.
If the first operator value is false, the third value is returned.

The first value must be a boolean (must have the type `Bool`).
The second value and third value can be of any type.
The result type is the least common supertype of the second and third value.

```bamboo,file=operator-ternary-conditional.bpl
let x = 1 > 2 ? 3 : 4
// `x` is `4` and has type `Int`

let y = 1 > 2 ? nil : 3
// `y` is `3` and has type `Int?`
```

### Precedence and Associativity

Operators have the following precedences, highest to lowest:

- Multiplication precedence: `*`, `&*`, `/`, `%`
- Addition precedence: `+`, `&+`, `-`, `&-`
- Relational precedence: `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`
- Equality precedence: `==`, `!=`
- Logical conjunction precedence: `&&`
- Logical disjunction precedence: `||`
- Ternary precedence: `? :`

All operators are left-associative, except for the ternary operator, which is right-associative.

Expressions can be wrapped in parentheses to override precedence conventions, i.e. an alternate order should be indicated, or when the default order should be emphasized, e.g. to avoid confusion. For example, `(2 + 3) * 4` forces addition to precede multiplication, and `5 + (6 * 7)` reinforces the default order.

## Functions

Functions are sequences of statements that perform a specific task. Functions have parameters (inputs) and an optional return value (output). Functions are typed: the function type consists of the parameter types and the return type.

Functions are values, i.e., they can be assigned to constants and variables, and can be passed as arguments to other functions. This behavior is often called "first-class functions".

### Function Declarations

Functions can be declared by using the `fun` keyword, followed by the name of the declaration, the parameters, the optional return type, and the code that should be executed when the function is called.

The parameters need to be enclosed in parentheses.
The return type, if any, is separated from the parameters by a colon (`:`).
The function code needs to be enclosed in opening and closing braces.

Each parameter must have a name, which is the name that the argument value will be available as within the function.

An additional argument label can be provided to require function calls to use the label to provide an argument value for the parameter.

Argument labels make code more explicit and readable.
For example, they avoid confusion about the order of arguments when there are multiple arguments that have the same type.

Argument labels should be named so they make sense from the perspective of the function call.

Argument labels precede the parameter name.
The special argument label `_` indicates that a function call can omit the argument label.
If no argument label is declared in the function declaration,
the parameter name is the argument label of the function declaration,
and function calls must use the parameter name as the argument label.

Each parameter needs to have a type annotation, which follows the parameter name after a colon.

Function calls may provide arguments for parameters which are subtypes of the parameter types.

There is **no** support for optional parameters, i.e. default values for parameters,
and variadic functions, i.e. functions that take an arbitrary amount of arguments.

```bamboo,file=function-double.bpl
// Declare a function named `double`, which multiples a number by two.
//
// The special argument label _ is specified for the parameter,
// so no argument label has to be provided in a function call.
//
fun double(_ x: Int): Int {
    return x * 2
}

// Call the function named `double` with the value 4 for the first parameter.
//
// The argument label can be omitted in the function call as the declaration
// specifies the special argument label _ for the parameter.
//
double(2)  // is `4`
```

It is possible to require argument labels for some parameters,
and not require argument labels for other parameters.

```bamboo,file=function-clamp.bpl
// Declare a function named `clamp`. The function takes an integer value,
// the lower limit, and the upper limit. It returns an integer between
// the lower and upper limit.
//
// For the first parameter the special argument label _ is used,
// so no argument label has to be given for it in a function call.
//
// For the second and third parameter no argument label is given,
// so the parameter names are the argument labels, i.e., the parameter names
// have to be given as argument labels in a function call.
//
fun clamp(_ value: Int, min: Int, max: Int): Int {
    if value > max {
        return max
    }

    if value < min {
        return min
    }

    return value
}

// Declare a constant which has the result of a call to the function
// named `clamp` as its initial value.
//
// For the first argument no label is given, as it is not required by
// the function declaration (the special argument label `_` is specified).
//
// For the second and this argument the labels must be provided,
// as the function declaration does not specify the special argument label `_`
// for these two parameters.
//
// As the function declaration also does not specify argument labels
// for these parameters, the parameter names must be used as argument labels.
//
let clamped = clamp(123, min: 0, max: 100)
// `clamped` is `100`
```

```bamboo,file=function-send.bpl
// Declare a function named `send`, which transfers an amount
// from one account to another.
//
// The implementation is omitted for brevity.
//
// The first two parameters of the function have the same type, so there is
// a potential that a function call accidentally provides arguments in
// the wrong order.
//
// While the parameter names `sendingAccount` and `receivingAccount`
// are descriptive inside the function, they might be too verbose
// to require them as argument labels in function calls.
//
// For this reason the shorter argument labels `from` and `to` are specified,
// which still convey the meaning of the two parameters without being overly
// verbose.
//
// The name of the third parameter, `amount`, is both meaningful inside
// the function and also in a function call, so no argument label is given,
// and the parameter name is required as the argument label in a function call.
//
fun send(from sendingAccount: Account, to receivingAccount: Account, amount: Int) {
    // The function code is omitted for brevity.
    // ...
}

// Declare a constant which refers to the sending account.
//
// The initial value is omitted for brevity.
//
let sender: Account = // ...

// Declare a constant which refers to the receiving account.
//
// The initial value is omitted for brevity.
//
let receiver: Account = // ...

// Call the function named `send`.
//
// The function declaration requires argument labels for all parameters,
// so they need to be provided in the function call.
//
// This avoids ambiguity. For example, in some languages (like C) it is
// a convention to order the parameters so that the receiver occurs first,
// followed by the sender. In other languages, it is common to have
// the sender be the first parameter, followed by the receiver.
//
// Here, the order is clear – send an amount from an account to another account.
//
send(from: sender, to: receiver, amount: 100)
```

The order of the arguments in a function call must match the order of the parameters in the function declaration.

```bamboo,file=function-test.bpl
// Declare a function named `test`, which accepts two parameters, named `first` and `second`
//
fun test(first: Int, second: Int) {
    // ...
}

// Invalid: the arguments are provided in the wrong order,
// even though the argument labels are provided correctly.
//
test(second: 1, first: 2)
```

Functions can be nested, i.e., the code of a function may declare further functions.

```bamboo,file=function-doubleAndAddOne.bpl
// Declare a function which multiplies a number by two, and adds one.
//
fun doubleAndAddOne(_ x: Int): Int {

    // Declare a nested function which multiplies a number by two.
    //
    fun double(_ x: Int) {
        return x * 2
    }

    return double(x) + 1
}

doubleAndAddOne(2)  // is `5`
```

### Function overloading

> 🚧 Status: Function overloading is not implemented.

It is possible to declare functions with the same name, as long as they have different sets of argument labels.
This is known as function overloading.

```bamboo,file=function-overloading.bpl
// Declare a function named "assert" which requires a test value
// and a message argument.
//
fun assert(_ test: Bool, message: String) {
    // ...
}

// Declare a function named "assert" which only requires a test value.
// The function calls the `assert` function declared above.
//
fun assert(_ test: Bool) {
    assert(test, message: "test is false")
}
```

### Function Expressions

Functions can be also used as expressions.
The syntax is the same as for function declarations, except that function expressions have no name, i.e., they are anonymous.

```bamboo,file=function-expression.bpl
// Declare a constant named `double`, which has a function as its value.
//
// The function multiplies a number by two when it is called.
//
// This function's type is `((Int): Int)`.
//
let double =
    fun (_ x: Int): Int {
        return x * 2
    }
```

### Function Calls

Functions can be called (invoked). Function calls need to provide exactly as many argument values as the function has parameters.

```bamboo,file=function-call.bpl
fun double(_ x: Int): Int {
    return x * 2
}

// Valid: the correct amount of arguments is provided.
//
double(2)  // is `4`

// Invalid: too many arguments are provided.
//
double(2, 3)

// Invalid: too few arguments are provided.
//
double()
```

### Function Types

Function types consist of the function's parameter types and the function's return type.

The parameter types need to be enclosed in parentheses, followed by a colon (`:`), and end with the return type.
The whole function type needs to be enclosed in parentheses.

```bamboo,file=function-type.bpl
// Declare a function named `add`, with the function type `((Int, Int): Int)`.
//
fun add(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
    return a + b
}
```

```bamboo,file=function-type-expression.bpl
// Declare a constant named `add`, with the function type `((Int, Int): Int)`
//
let add: ((Int, Int): Int) =
    fun (a: Int, b: Int): Int {
        return a + b
    }
```

If the function has no return type, it implicitly has the return type `Void`.

```bamboo,file=function-doNothing.bpl
// Declare a constant named `doNothing`, which is a function
// that takes no parameters and returns nothing.
//
let doNothing: ((): Void) =
    fun () {}
```

Parentheses also control precedence.
For example, a function type `((Int): ((): Int))` is the type for a function which accepts one argument with type `Int`,
and which returns another function, that takes no arguments and returns an `Int`.

The type `[((Int): Int); 2]` specifies an array type of two functions, which accept one integer and return one integer.

Argument labels are not part of the function type.
This has the advantage that functions with different argument labels, potentially written by different authors are compatible as long as the parameter types and the return type match.
It has the disadvantage that function calls to plain function values,
cannot accept argument labels.

```bamboo,file=function-no-argument-labels.bpl
// Declare a function which takes one argument that has type `Int`.
// The function has type `((Int): Void)`.
//
fun foo1(x: Int) {}

// Call function `foo1`. This requires an argument label.
foo1(x: 1)

// Declare another function which takes one argument that has type `Int`.
// The function also has type `((Int): Void)`.
//
fun foo2(y: Int) {}

// Call function `foo2`. This requires an argument label.
foo2(y: 2)

// Declare a variable which has type `((Int): Void)` and use `foo1`
// as its initial value.
//
var someFoo: ((Int): Void) = foo1

// Call the function assigned to variable `someFoo`.
// This is valid as the function types match.
// This does neither require nor allow argument labels.
//
someFoo(3)

// Assign function `foo2` to variable `someFoo`.
// This is valid as the function types match.
//
someFoo = foo2

// Call the function assigned to variable `someFoo`.
// This does neither require nor allow argument labels.
//
someFoo(4)
```

### Closures

A function may refer to variables and constants of its outer scopes in which it is defined.
It is called a closure, because it is closing over those variables and constants.
A closure can can read from the variables and constants and assign to the variables it refers to.

```bamboo,file=closures-counter.bpl
// Declare a function named `makeCounter` which returns a function that
// each time when called, returns the next integer, starting at 1.
//
fun makeCounter(): ((): Int) {
    var count = 0
    return fun (): Int {
        // NOTE: read from and assign to the non-local variable
        // `count`, which is declared in the outer function.
        //
        count = count + 1
        return count
    }
}

let test = makeCounter()
test()  // is `1`
test()  // is `2`
```

### Argument Passing Behavior

When arguments are passed to a function, they are copied.
Therefore, values that are passed into a function are unchanged in the caller's scope when the function returns.
This behavior is known as [call-by-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Evaluation_strategy&oldid=896280571#Call_by_value).

```bamboo,file=function-change.bpl
// Declare a function that changes the first two elements
// of an array of integers.
//
fun change(_ numbers: [Int]) {
    // Change the elements of the passed in array.
    // The changes are only local, as the array was copied.
    //
    numbers[0] = 1
    numbers[1] = 2
    // `numbers` is `[1, 2]`
}

let numbers = [0, 1]

change(numbers)
// `numbers` is still `[0, 1]`
```

Parameters are constant, i.e., it is not allowed to assign to them.

```bamboo,file=function-parameter-assignment.bpl
fun test(x: Int) {
    // Invalid: cannot assign to a parameter (constant)
    //
    x = 2
}
```

### Function Preconditions and Postconditions

Functions may have preconditions and may have postconditions. Preconditions and postconditions can be used to restrict the inputs (values for parameters) and output (return value) of a function.

Preconditions must be true right before the execution of the function. Preconditions are part of the function and introduced by the `pre` keyword, followed by the condition block.

Postconditions must be true right after the execution of the function. Postconditions are part of the function and introduced by the `post` keyword, followed by the condition block. Postconditions may only occur after preconditions, if any.

A conditions block consists of one or more conditions. Conditions are expressions evaluating to a boolean. They may not call functions, i.e., they cannot have side-effects and must be pure expressions. Also, conditions may not contain function expressions.

<!--

TODO:

For now, function calls are not allowed in preconditions and postconditions.
See https://github.com/dapperlabs/bamboo-runtime/issues/84

-->

Conditions may be written on separate lines, or multiple conditions can be written on the same line, separated by a semicolon. This syntax follows the syntax for [statements](#semicolons).

Following each condition, an optional description can be provided after a colon.
The condition description is used as an error message when the condition fails.

In postconditions, the special constant `result` refers to the result of the function.

```bamboo,file=function-factorial.bpl
fun factorial(_ n: Int): Int {
    pre {
        // Require the parameter `n` to be greater than or equal to zero.
        //
        n >= 0:
            "factorial is only defined for integers greater than or equal to zero"
    }
    post {
        // Ensure the result will be greater than or equal to 1.
        //
        result >= 1:
            "the result must be greater than or equal to 1"
    }

    if n < 1 {
       return 1
    }

    return n * factorial(n - 1)
}

factorial(5)  // is `120`

// Run-time error: The given argument does not satisfy the precondition `n >= 0` of the function, the program aborts.
//
factorial(-2)
```

In postconditions, the special function `before` can be used to get the value of an expression just before the function is called.

```bamboo,file=function-increment.bpl
var n = 0

fun incrementN() {
    post {
        // Require the new value of `n` to be the old value of `n`, plus one.
        //
        n == before(n) + 1:
            "n must be incremented by 1"
    }

    n = n + 1
}
```

## Control flow

Control flow statements control the flow of execution in a function.

### Conditional branching: if-statement

If-statements allow a certain piece of code to be executed only when a given condition is true.

The if-statement starts with the `if` keyword, followed by the condition, and the code that should be executed if the condition is true inside opening and closing braces.
The condition must be boolean and the braces are required.
The braces are required and not optional.
Parentheses around the condition are optional.

```bamboo,file=control-flow-if.bpl
let a = 0
var b = 0

if a == 0 {
   b = 1
}

// Parentheses can be used around the condition, but are not required.
if (a != 0) {
   b = 2
}

// `b` is `1`
```

An additional, optional else-clause can be added to execute another piece of code when the condition is false.
The else-clause is introduced by the `else` keyword followed by braces that contain the code that should be executed.

```bamboo,file=control-flow-if-else.bpl
let a = 0
var b = 0

if a == 1 {
   b = 1
} else {
   b = 2
}

// `b` is `2`
```

The else-clause can contain another if-statement, i.e., if-statements can be chained together.
In this case the braces can be omitted.

```bamboo,file=control-flow-if-else-if.bpl
let a = 0
var b = 0

if a == 1 {
   b = 1
} else if a == 2 {
   b = 2
} else {
   b = 3
}

// `b` is `3`

if a == 1 {
   b = 1
} else {
    if a == 0 {
        b = 2
    }
}

// `b` is `2`
```

### Optional Binding

Optional binding allows getting the value inside an optional.
It is a variant of the if-statement.

If the optional contains a value, the first branch is executed and a temporary constant or variable is declared and set to the value contained in the optional; otherwise, the else branch (if any) is executed.

Optional bindings are declared using the `if` keyword like an if-statement, but instead of the boolean test value, it is followed by the `let` or `var` keywords, to either introduce a constant or variable, followed by a name, the equal sign (`=`), and the optional value.

```bamboo,file=control-flow-optional-binding-not-nil.bpl
let maybeNumber: Int? = 1

if let number = maybeNumber {
    // This branch is executed as `maybeNumber` is not `nil`.
    // The constant `number` is `1` and has type `Int`.
} else {
    // This branch is *not* executed as `maybeNumber` is not `nil`
}
```

```bamboo,file=control-flow-optional-binding-nil.bpl
let noNumber: Int? = nil

if let number = noNumber {
    // This branch is *not* executed as `noNumber` is `nil`.
} else {
    // This branch is executed as `noNumber` is `nil`.
    // The constant `number` is *not* available.
}
```

### Looping: while-statement

While-statements allow a certain piece of code to be executed repeatedly, as long as a condition remains true.

The while-statement starts with the `while` keyword, followed by the condition, and the code that should be repeatedly executed if the condition is true inside opening and closing braces.
The condition must be boolean and the braces are required.

The while-statement will first evaluate the condition.
If the condition is false, the execution is done.
If it is true, the piece of code is executed and the evaluation of the condition is repeated.
Thus, the piece of code is executed zero or more times.

```bamboo,file=control-flow-while.bpl
var a = 0
while a < 5 {
    a = a + 1
}

// `a` is `5`
```

The `continue` statement can be used to stop the current iteration of the loop and start the next iteration.

```bamboo,file=control-flow-continue.bpl
var i = 0
var x = 0
while i < 10 {
    i = i + 1
    if i < 3 {
        continue
    }
    x = x + 1
}

// `x` is `8`
```

The `break` statement can be used to stop the loop.

```bamboo,file=control-flow-break.bpl
var x = 0
while x < 10 {
    x = x + 1
    if x == 5 {
        break
    }
}

// `x` is `5`
```

### Immediate function return: return-statement

The return-statement causes a function to return immediately, i.e., any code after the return-statement is not executed. The return-statement starts with the `return` keyword and is followed by an optional expression that should be the return value of the function call.

<!--
TODO: examples

- in function
- in while
- in if
-->

## Scope

Every function and block (`{` ... `}`) introduces a new scope for declarations. Each function and block can refer to declarations in its scope or any of the outer scopes.

```bamboo,file=scope.bpl
let x = 10

fun f(): Int {
    let y = 10
    return x + y
}

f()  // is `20`

// Invalid: the identifier `y` is not in scope.
//
y
```

```bamboo,file=scope-doubleAndAddOne.bpl
fun doubleAndAddOne(_ n: Int): Int {
    fun double(_ x: Int) {
        return x * 2
    }
    return double(n) + 1
}

// Invalid: the identifier `double` is not in scope.
//
double(1)
```

Each scope can introduce new declarations, i.e., the outer declaration is shadowed.

```bamboo,file=scope-test.bpl
let x = 2

fun test(): Int {
    let x = 3
    return x
}

test()  // is `3`
```

Scope is lexical, not dynamic.

```bamboo,file=scope-lexical.bpl
let x = 10

fun f(): Int {
   return x
}

fun g(): Int {
   let x = 20
   return f()
}

g()  // is `10`, not `20`
```

Declarations are **not** moved to the top of the enclosing function (hoisted).

```bamboo,file=scope-no-hoisting.bpl
let x = 2

fun f(): Int {
    if x == 0 {
        let x = 3
        return x
    }
    return x
}
f()  // is `2`
```

## Type Safety

The Bamboo programming language is a *type-safe* language.

When assigning a new value to a variable, the value must be the same type as the variable. For example, if a variable has type `Bool`, it can *only* be assigned a value that has type `Bool`, and not for example a value that has type `Int`.

```bamboo,file=type-safety-assign-int-to-bool.bpl
// Declare a variable that has type `Bool`.
var a = true

// Invalid: cannot assign a value that has type `Int` to a variable which has type `Bool`.
//
a = 0
```

When passing arguments to a function, the types of the values must match the function parameters' types. For example, if a function expects an argument that has type `Bool`, *only* a value that has type `Bool` can be provided, and not for example a value which has type `Int`.

```bamboo,file=type-safety-nand.bpl
fun nand(_ a: Bool, _ b: Bool): Bool {
    return !(a && b)
}

nand(false, false)  // is `true`

// Invalid: The arguments of the function calls are integers and have type `Int`,
// but the function expects parameters booleans (type `Bool`).
//
nand(0, 0)
```

Types are **not** automatically converted.
For example, an integer is not automatically converted to a boolean,
nor is an `Int32` automatically converted to an `Int8`,
nor is an optional integer `Int?` automatically converted to a non-optional integer `Int`,
or vice-versa.

```bamboo,file=type-safety-add.bpl
fun add(_ a: Int8, _ b: Int8): Int {
    return a + b
}

// The arguments are not declared with a specific type, but they are inferred
// to be `Int8` since the parameter types of the function `add` are `Int8`.
add(1, 2)  // is `3`

// Declare two constants which have type `Int32`.
//
let a: Int32 = 3_000_000_000
let b: Int32 = 3_000_000_000

// Invalid: cannot pass arguments which have type `Int32` to parameters which have type `Int8`.
//
add(a, b)
```

## Type Inference

> 🚧 Status: Only basic type inference is implemented.

If a variable or constant declaration is not annotated explicitly with a type,
the declaration's type is inferred from the initial value.

Integer literals are inferred to type `Int`.

```bamboo,file=type-inference-int.bpl
let a = 1

// `a` has type `Int`
```

Array literals are inferred based on the elements of the literal, and to be variable-size.

```bamboo,file=type-inference-intergers.bpl
let integers = [1, 2]
// `integers` has type `[Int]`

// Invalid: mixed types
//
let invalidMixed = [1, true, 2, false]
```

Dictionary literals are inferred based on the keys and values of the literal.

```bamboo,file=type-inference-dictionary.bpl
let booleans = {
    1: true,
    2: false
}
// `booleans` has type `{Int: Bool}`

// Invalid: mixed types
//
let invalidMixed = {
    1: true,
    false: 2
}
```

Functions are inferred based on the parameter types and the return type.

```bamboo,file=type-inference-function.bpl
let add = (a: Int8, b: Int8): Int {
    return a + b
}

// `add` has type `((Int8, Int8): Int)`
```

Type inference is performed for each expression / statement, and not across statements.

There are cases where types cannot be inferred.
In these cases explicit type annotations are required.

```bamboo,file=type-inference-impossible.bpl
// Invalid: not possible to infer type based on array literal's elements.
//
let array = []

// Instead, specify the array type and the concrete element type, e.g. `Int`.
//
let arrary: [Int] = []
```

```bamboo
// Invalid: not possible to infer type based on dictionary literal's keys and values.
//
let dictionary = {}

// Instead, specify the dictionary type and the concrete key
// and value types, e.g. `String` and `Int`.
//
let dictionary: {String: Int} = {}
```

```bamboo
// Invalid: not possible to infer type based on nil literal.
//
let maybeSomething = nil

// Instead, specify the optional type and the concrete element type, e.g. `Int`.
//
let maybeSomething: Int? = nil
```

## Composite Data Types

Composite data types allow composing simpler types into more complex types, i.e., they allow the composition of multiple values into one. Composite data types have a name and consist of zero or more named fields, and zero or more functions that operate on the data. Each field may have a different type.

There are two kinds of composite data types.
The kinds differ in their usage and the behaviour when a value is used as the initial value for a constant or variable,
when the value is assigned to a variable,
when the value is passed as an argument to a function,
and when the value is returned from a function:

- [**Structures**](#structures) are **copied**, i.e. they are value types.

    Structures are useful when copies with independent state are desired.

- [**Resources**](#resources) are **moved**, they are linear types and **must** be used **exactly once**.

    Resources are useful when it is desired to model ownership (a value exists exactly in one location and it should not be lost).

    Certain constructs in a blockchain represent assets of real, tangible value, as much as a house or car or bank account.
    We have to worry about literal loss and theft, perhaps even on the scale of millions of dollars.

    Structures are not an ideal way to represent this ownership because they are copied.
    This would mean that there could be a risk of having multiple copies of certain assets floating around, which breaks the scarcity requirements needed for these assets to have real value.

    A structure is much more useful for representing information that can be grouped together in a logical way, but doesn't have value or a need to be able to be owned or transferred.

    A structure could for example be used to contain the information associated with a division of a company, but a resource would be used to represent the assets that have been allocated to that organization for spending.

Nesting of resources is only allowed within other resource types,
or in data structures like arrays and dictionaries,
but not in structures, as that would allow resources to be copied.

### Composite Data Type Declaration and Creation

Structures are declared using the `struct` keyword and resources are declared using the `resource` keyword. The keyword is followed by the name.

```bamboo,file=composite-data-type-declaration.bpl
struct SomeStruct {
    // ...
}

resource SomeResource {
    // ...
}
```

Structures and resources are types.

Structures are created (instantiated) by calling the type like a function.

```bamboo,file=structure-instantiation.bpl
SomeStruct()
```

Resource must be created (instantiated) by using the `create` keyword and calling the type like a function.

```bamboo,file=resource-instantiation.bpl
create SomeResource()
```

The constructor function may require parameters
if the [initializer](#composite-data-type-fields) of the composite data type requires them.

Composite data types can only be declared globally and not locally in functions.
They can also not be nested.

### Composite Data Type Fields

Fields are declared like variables and constants.
However, the initial values for fields are set in the initializer,
**not** in the field declaration.
All fields **must** be initialized in the initializer, exactly once.

Having to provide intitial values in the initializer might seem restrictive,
but this ensures that all fields are always initialized in one location, the initializer,
and the initialization order is clear.

The initialization of all fields is checked statically
and it is invalid to not initialize all fields in the initializer.
Also, it is statically checked that a field is definitely initialized before it is used.

The initializer's main purpose is to initialize fields, though it may also contain other code.
Just like a function, it may declare parameters and may contain arbitrary code.
However, it has no return type, i.e., it is always `Void`.

The initializer is declared using the `init` keyword.

The initializer always follows any fields.

There are three kinds of fields:

- **Constant fields** are also stored in the composite value,
  but after they have been inititalized with a value they **cannot** have new values assigned to them afterwards.
  A constant field must be initialized exactly once.

  Constant fields are declared using the `let` keyword.

- **Variable fields** are stored in the composite value and can have new values assigned to them.

  Variable fields are declared using the `var` keyword.

- **Synthetic fields** are **not stored** in the composite value,
  i.e. they are derived/computed from other values.
  They can have new values assigned to them.

  Synthetic fields are declared using the `synthetic` keyword.

  Synthetic fields must have a getter and a setter.
  Getters and setters are explained in the [next section](#composite-data-type-field-getters-and-setters).
  Synthetic fields are explained in a [separate section](#synthetic-composite-data-type-fields).

| Field Kind           | Stored in memory | Assignable         | Keyword     |
|----------------------|------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| **Variable field**   | Yes              | Yes                | `var`       |
| **Constant field**   | Yes              | **No**             | `let`       |
| **Synthetic field**  | **No**           | Yes                | `synthetic` |

In initializers, the special constant `self` refers to the composite value that is to be initialized.

Fields can be read (if they are constant or variable) and set (if they are variable), using the access syntax: the composite value is followed by a dot (`.`) and the name of the field.

```bamboo,file=composite-data-type-fields-and-init.bpl
// Declare a structure named `Token`, which has a constant field
// named `id` and a variable field named `balance`.
//
// Both fields are initialized through the initializer.
//
// The public access modifier `pub` is used in this example to allow
// thes fields to be read in outer scopes. Fields can also be declared
// private so they cannot be accessed in outer scopes.
// Access control will be explained in a later section.
//
struct Token {
    pub let id: Int
    pub var balance: Int

    init(id: Int, balance: Int) {
        self.id = id
        self.balance = balance
    }
}
```

Note that it is invalid to provide the initial value for a field in the field declaration.

```bamboo
struct StructureWithConstantField {
    // Invalid: It is invalid to provide an initial value in the field declaration.
    // The field must be initialized by setting the initial value in the initializer.
    //
    pub let id: Int = 1
}
```

The field access syntax must be used to access fields –  fields are not available as variables.

```bamboo
struct Token {
    pub let id: Int

    init(initialID: Int) {
        // Invalid: There is no variable with the name `id` available.
        // The field `id` must be initialized by setting `self.id`.
        //
        id = initialID
    }
}
```

The initializer is **not** automatically derived from the fields, it must be explicitly declared.

```bamboo
struct Token {
    pub let id: Int

    // Invalid: Missing initializer initializing field `id`.
}
```

A composite value can be created by calling the constructor and the value's fields can be accessed.

```bamboo,file=composite-data-type-fields-assignment.bpl
let token = Token(id: 42, balance: 1_000_00)

token.id  // is `42`
token.balance  // is `1_000_000`

token.balance = 1
// `token.balance` is `1`

// Invalid: assignment to constant field
//
token.id = 23
```

Initializers support overloading. This allows for example providing default values for certain parameters.

```bamboo,file=composite-data-type-initializer-overloading.bpl
// Declare a structure named `Token`, which has a constant field
// named `id` and a variable field named `balance`.
//
// The first initializer allows initializing both fields with a given value.
//
// A second initializer is provided for convenience to initialize the `id` field
// with a given value, and the `balance` field with the default value `0`.
//
struct Token {
    let id: Int
    var balance: Int

    init(id: Int, balance: Int) {
        self.id = id
        self.balance = balance
    }

    init(id: Int) {
        self.id = id
        self.balance = 0
    }
}
```

### Composite Data Type Field Getters and Setters

Fields may have an optional getter and an optional setter. Getters are functions that are called when a field is read, and setters are functions that are called when a field is written.  Assignments are not allowed at all in getters and setters.

Getters and setters are enclosed in opening and closing braces, after the field's type.

Getters are declared using the `get` keyword. Getters have no parameters and their return type is implicitly the type of the field.

```bamboo,file=composite-data-type-field-getter.bpl
struct GetterExample {

    // Declare a variable field named `balance` with a getter
    // which ensures the read value is always non-negative.
    //
    pub var balance: Int {
        get {
           post {
               result >= 0
           }

           if self.balance < 0 {
               return 0
           }

           return self.balance
        }
    }

    init(balance: Int) {
        self.balance = balance
    }
}

let example = GetterExample(balance: 10)
// `example.balance` is `10`

example.balance = -50
// `example.balance` is `0`. Without the getter it would be `-50`.
```

Setters are declared using the `set` keyword, followed by the name for the new value enclosed in parentheses.
The parameter has implicitly the type of the field. Another type cannot be specified. Setters have no return type.

The types of values assigned to setters must always match the field's type.

```bamboo,file=composite-data-type-field-setter.bpl
struct SetterExample {

    // Declare a variable field named `balance` with a setter
    // which requires written values to be positive.
    //
    pub var balance: Int {
        set(newBalance) {
            pre {
                newBalance >= 0
            }
            self.balance = newBalance
        }
    }

    init(balance: Int) {
        self.balance = balance
    }
}

let example = SetterExample(balance: 10)
// `example.balance` is `10`

// Run-time error: The precondition of the setter for the field `balance` fails, the program aborts.
example.balance = -50
```

### Synthetic Composite Data Type Fields

Fields which are not stored in the composite value are *synthetic*, i.e., the field value is computed.
Synthetic can be either read-only, or readable and writable.

Synthetic fields are declared using the `synthetic` keyword.

Synthetic fields are read-only when only a getter is provided.

```bamboo,file=composite-type-synthetic-field-getter-only.bpl
struct Rectangle {
    pub var width: Int
    pub var height: Int

    // Declare a synthetic field named `area`,
    // which computes the area based on the `width` and `height` fields.
    //
    pub synthetic area: Int {
        get {
            return width * height
        }
    }

    // Declare an initializer which accepts width and height.
    // As `area` is synthetic and there is only a getter provided for it,
    // the `area` field it cannot be assigned a value.
    //
    init(width: Int, height: Int) {
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
    }
}
```

Synthetic fields are readable and writable when both a getter and a setter is declared.

```bamboo,file=composite-type-synthetic-field-setter-getter.bpl
// Declare a struct named `GoalTracker` which stores a number
// of target goals, a number of completed goals,
// and has a synthetic field to provide the left number of goals.
//
// NOTE: the tracker only implements some functionality to demonstrate
// synthetic fields, it is incomplete (e.g. assignments to `goal` are not handled properly).
//
struct GoalTracker {

    pub var goal: Int
    pub var completed: Int

    // Declare a synthetic field which is both readable and writable.
    //
    // When the field is read from (in the getter), the number
    // of left goals is computed from the target number of goals
    // and the completed number of goals.
    //
    // When the field is written to (in the setter), the number
    // of completed goals is updated, based on the number
    // of target goals and the new remaining number of goals.
    //
    pub synthetic left: Int {
        get {
            return self.goal - self.completed
        }

        set(newLeft) {
            self.completed = self.goal - newLeft
        }
    }

    init(goal: Int, completed: Int) {
        self.goal = goal
        self.completed = completed
    }
}

let tracker = GoalTracker(goal: 10, completed: 0)
// `tracker.goal` is `10`
// `tracker.completed` is `0`
// `tracker.left` is `10`

tracker.completed = 1
// `tracker.left` is `9`

tracker.left = 8
// `tracker.completed` is `2`
```

It is invalid to declare a synthetic field with only a setter.

### Composite Data Type Functions

Composite data types may contain functions.
Just like in the initializer, the special constant `self` refers to the composite value that the function is called on.

```bamboo,file=composite-data-type-function.bpl
// Declare a structure named "Rectangle", which represents a rectangle
// and has variable fields for the width and height.
//
struct Rectangle {
    pub var width: Int
    pub var height: Int

    init(width: Int, height: Int) {
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
    }

    // Declare a function named "scale", which scales
    // the rectangle by the given factor.
    //
    pub fun scale(factor: Int) {
        self.width = self.width * factor
        self.height = self.height * factor
    }
}

let rectangle = Rectangle(width: 2, height: 3)
rectangle.scale(factor: 4)
// `rectangle.width` is `8`
// `rectangle.height` is `12`
```

Functions support overloading.

```bamboo,file=composite-data-type-function-overloading.bpl
// Declare a structure named "Rectangle", which represents a rectangle
// and has variable fields for the width and height.
//
struct Rectangle {
    pub var width: Int
    pub var height: Int

    init(width: Int, height: Int) {
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
    }

    // Declare a function named "scale", which independently scales
    // the width by a given factor and the height by a given factor.
    //
    pub fun scale(widthFactor: Int, heightFactor: Int) {
        self.width = self.width * widthFactor
        self.height = self.height * heightFactor
    }

    // Declare a another function also named "scale", which scales
    // both width and height by a given factor.
    // The function calls the `scale` function declared above.
    //
    pub fun scale(factor: Int) {
        self.scale(
            widthFactor: factor,
            heightFactor: factor
        )
    }
}
```

### Composite Data Type Subtyping

Two composite data types are compatible if and only if they refer to the same declaration by name,
i.e., nominal typing applies instead of structural typing.

Even if two composite data types declare the same fields and functions,
the types are only compatible if their names match.

```bamboo,file=composite-data-type.bpl
// Declare a structure named `A` which has a function `test`
// which has type `((): Void)`.
//
struct A {
    fun test() {}
}

// Declare a structure named `B` which has a function `test`
// which has type `((): Void)`.
//
struct B {
    fun test() {}
}

// Declare a variable named which accepts values of type `A`.
//
var something: A = A()

// Invalid: Assign a value of type `B` to the variable.
// Even though types `A` and `B` have the same declarations,
// a function with the same name and type, the types' names differ,
// so they are not compatbile.
//
something = B()

// Valid: Reassign a new value of type `A`.
//
something = A()
```

### Composite Data Type Behaviour

#### Structures

Structures are **copied** when used as an initial value for constant or variable,
when assigned to a different variable,
when passed as an argument to a function,
and when returned from a function.

Accessing a field or calling a function of a structure does not copy it.

```bamboo,file=struct-behavior.bpl
// Declare a structure named `SomeStruct`, with a variable integer field.
//
struct SomeStruct {
    pub var value: Int

    init(value: Int) {
        self.value = value
    }

    fun increment() {
        self.value = self.value + 1
    }
}

// Declare a constant with value of structure type `SomeStruct`.
//
let a = SomeStruct(value: 0)

// *Copy* the structure value into a new constant.
//
let b = a

b.value = 1
// NOTE: `b.value` is 1, `a.value` is *`0`*

b.increment()
// `b.value` is 2, `a.value` is `0`
```

#### Resources

Resources are types that can only exist in **one** location at a time and **must** be used **exactly once**.

Resources **must** be created (instantiated) by using the `create` keyword.

At the end of a function which has resources (variables, constants, parameters) in scope,
the resources **must** be either **moved** or **destroyed**.

They are **moved** when used as an initial value for a constant or variable,
when assigned to a different variable,
when passed as an argument to a function,
and when returned from a function.

Resources are **destroyed** using the `destroy` keyword.

Accessing a field or calling a function of a resource does not move or destroy it.

When the resource was moved, the constant or variable that referred to the resource before the move becomes **invalid**.
An **invalid** resource cannot be used again.

To make the behaviour of resource types explicit, the move prefix `<-` must be used
in type annotations of variable or constant declarations, parameters, and return types.

To make moves of resources explicit, the move operator `<-` must be used
when the resource is the initial value of a constant or variable,
when it is moved to a different variable,
when it is moved to a function as an argument,
and when it is returned from a function.

```bamboo,file=resource-behavior.bpl
// Declare a resource named `SomeResource`, with a variable integer field.
//
resource SomeResource {
    pub var value: Int

    init(value: Int) {
        self.value = value
    }
}

// Declare a constant with value of resource type `SomeResource`.
//
let a: <-SomeResource <- SomeResource(value: 0)

// *Move* the resource value to a new constant.
//
let b <- a

// Invalid: Cannot use constant `a` anymore as the resource that it referred to
// was moved to constant `b`.
//
a.value

// Constant `b` owns the resource.
//
b.value = 1

// Declare a function which accepts a resource.
//
// The parameter has a resource type, so the type name must be prefixed with `<-`.
//
fun use(resource: <-SomeResource) {
    // ...
}

// Call function `use` and move the resource into it.
//
use(resource: <-b)

// Invalid: Cannot use constant `b` anymore as the resource
// it referred to was moved into function `foo`.
//
b.value
```

```bamboo,file=resource-loss.bpl
// Declare another, unrelated value of resource type `SomeResource`.
//
let c <- create SomeResource(value: 10)

// Invalid: `c` is not used, but must be; it cannot be lost.
```

```bamboo,file=resource-destruction.bpl
// Declare another, unrelated value of resource type `SomeResource`.
//
let d <- create SomeResource(value: 20)

// Destroy the resource referred to by constant `d`.
//
destroy d

// Invalid: Cannot use constant `d` anymore as the resource
// it referred to was destroyed.
//
d.value
```

To make it explicit that the type is moved, it must be prefixed with `<-` in all type annotations,
e.g. for variable declarations, parametes, or return types.

```bamboo,file=resource-type-annotation.bpl
// Declare a constant with an explicit type annotation.
//
// The constant has a resource type, so the type name must be prefixed with `<-`.
//
let someResource: <-SomeResource <- create SomeResource(value: 5)

// Declare a function which consumes a resource and destroys it.
//
// The parameter has a resource type, so the type name must be prefixed with `<-`.
//
fun use(resource: <-SomeResource) {
    destroy resource
}

// Declare a function which returns a resource.
//
// The return type is a resource type, so the type name must be prefixed with `<-`.
// The return statement must also use the `<-` operator to make it explicit the resource is moved.
//
fun get(): <-SomeResource {
    let newResource <- create SomeResource()
    return <-newResource
}
```

Resources **must** be used exactly once.

```bamboo,file=resource-must-use.bpl
// Declare a function which consumes a resource but does not use it.
// This function is invalid, because it would cause a loss of the resource.
//
fun forgetToUse(resource: <-SomeResource) {
    // Invalid: The resource parameter `resource` is not used, but must be.
}
```

```bamboo,file=resource-use-after-move.bpl
// Declare a constant named `res` which has the resource type `SomeResource`.
let res <- create SomeResource()

// Call the function `use` and move the resource `res` into it.
use(resource: <-res)

// Invalid: The resource constant `res` cannot be used again,
// as it was moved in the previous function call.
//
use(resource: <-res)

// Invalid: The resource constant `res` cannot be used again,
// as it was moved in the previous function call.
//
res.value
```

```bamboo,file=resource-not-used.bpl
// Declare a function which has a resource parameter but does not use it.
// This function is invalid, because it would cause a loss of the resource.
//
fun forgetToUse(resource: <-SomeResource) {
    // Invalid: The resource parameter `resource` is not used, but must be.
}
```

```bamboo,file=resource-not-definitely-destroyed.bpl
// Declare a function which has a resource parameter.
// This function is invalid, because it does not always use the resource parameter,
// which would cause a loss of the resource.
//
fun sometimesDestroy(resource: <-SomeResource, destroy: Bool) {
    if destroyResource {
        destroy resource
    }
    // Invalid: The resource parameter `resource` is not always used, but must be.
    // The destroy statement is not always executed, so at the end of this function
    // it might have been destroyed or not.
}
```

```bamboo,file=resource-always-invalidated.bpl
// Declare a function which has a resource parameter.
// This function is valid, as it always uses the resource parameter,
// and does not cause a loss of the resource.
//
fun alwaysUse(resource: <-SomeResource, destroyResource: Bool) {
    if destroyResource {
        destroy resource
    } else {
        use(resource: <-resource)
    }
    // At the end of the function the resource parameter was definitely used:
    // It was either destroyed or moved in the call of function `use`.
}
```

```bamboo,file=resource-loss-return.bpl
// Declare a function which has a resource parameter.
// This function is invalid, because it does not always use the resource parameter,
// which would cause a loss of the resource.
//
fun returnBeforeDestroy(: Bool) {
    let res <- create SomeResource(value: 1)
    if move {
        use(resource: <-res)
        return
    } else {
        // Invalid: When this function returns here, the resource variable
        // `res` was not used, but must be.
        return
    }
    // Invalid: the resource variable `res` was potentially moved in the
    // previous if-statement, and both branches definitely return,
    // so this statement is unreachable.
    destroy res
}
```

#### Resource variables

Resource variables cannot be assigned to as that would lead to the loss of the variable's current resource value.

Instead, use a swap statement (`<->`) to replace the resource variable with another resource.

```bamboo,file=resource-variable-invalid-assignment.bpl
resource R {}

var x <- create R()
var y <- create R()

// Invalid: Cannot assign to resource variable `x`,
// as its current resource would be lost
//
x <- y

// Instead, use a swap statement.
//
var replacement <- create R()
x <-> replacement
// `x` is the new resource.
// `replacement` is the old resource.
```

#### Resource Destructors

Resource may have a destructor, which is executed when the resource is destroyed.
Destructors have no parameters and no return value and are declared using the `destroy` name.
A resource may have only one destructor.

```bamboo,file=resource-destructor.bpl
var destructorCalled = false

resource Resource {

    // Declare a destructor for the resource, which is executed
    // when the resource is destroyed.
    //
    destroy() {
        destructorCalled = true
    }
}

let res <- create Resource()
destroy res
// `destructorCalled` is `true`
```

#### Nested Resources

Fields in composite data types behave diffently when they have a resource type.

If a resource type has fields that have a resource type it **must** declare a destructor,
which **must** invalidate all resource fields, i.e. move or destroy them.

```bamboo,file=resource-nested-field.bpl
resource Child {
    let name: String

    init(name: String)
        self.name = name
    }
}

// Declare a resource with a resource field named `child`.
// The resource *must* declare a destructor
// and the destructor *must* invalidate the resource field.
//
resource Parent {
    let name: String
    var child: <-Child

    init(name: String, child: <-Child) {
        self.name = name
        self.child <- child
    }

    // Declare a destructor which invalidates the resource field
    // `child` by destroying it.
    //
    destroy() {
        destroy self.child
    }
}
```

Accessing a field or calling function on a resource field is valid,
however moving a resource out of a variable resource field is **not** allowed.
Instead, use a swap statement to replace the resource with another resource.

```bamboo,file=resource-field-swap.bpl
let child <- create Child(name: "Child 1")
let parent <- create Parent(name: "Parent", child: <-child)

child.name  // is "Child"
parent.child.name  // is "Child"

// Invalid: Cannot move resource out of variable resource field.
let childAgain <- parent.child

// Instead, use a swap statement.
//
var otherChild <- create Child(name: "Child 2")
parent.child <-> otherChild
// `parent.child` is the second child, Child 2.
// `otherChild` is the first child, Child 1.
```

#### Resources in Closures

Resources can not be captured in closures, as that could potentially result in duplications.

```bamboo,file=resource-capturing
resource R {}

// Invalid: Declare a function which returns a closure which refers to
// the resource parameter `resource`. Each call to the returned function
// would return the resource, which should not be possible.
//
fun makeCloner(resource: <-R): ((): <-R) {
    return fun (): <-R {
        return <-resource
    }
}

let test = makeCloner(resource: <-create R())
```

#### Resources in Arrays and Dictionaries

Arrays and dictionaries behave differently when they contain resources:
Indexing into an array to read an element at a certain index or assign to it,
or indexing into a dictionary to read a value for a certain key or set a value for the key is **not** allowed.

Instead, use a swap statement to replace the accessed resource with another resource.

```bamboo,file=resource-in-array.bpl
resource R {}

// Declare a constant for an array of resources.
// Create two resources and move them into the array.
//
let resources <- [
    <-create R(),
    <-create R()
]

// Invalid: Reading an element from a resource array is not allowed.
//
let firstResource <- resources[0]

// Invalid: Setting an element in a resource array is not allowed,
// as it would result in the loss of the current value.
//
resources[0] <- create R()

// Instead, when attempting to either read an element or update an element
// in a resource array, use a swap statement with a variable to replace
// the accessed element.
//
var res <- create R()
resources[0] <-> res
// `resources[0]` now contains the new resource.
// `res` now contains the old resource.
```

The same applies to dictionaries.

```bamboo,file=resource-in-dictionary.bpl
// Declare a constant for a dictionary of resources.
// Create three resources and move them into the dictionary.
//
let resources <- {
    "r1": <-create R(),
    "r2": <-create R()
}

// Invalid: Reading an element from a resource dictionary is not allowed.
//
let firstResource <- resources["r1"]

// Invalid: Setting an element in a resource dictionary is not allowed,
// as it would result in the loss of the current value.
//
resources["r1"] <- create R()

// Instead, when attempting to either read an element or update an element
// in a resource dictionary, use a swap statement with a variable to replace
// the accessed element.
//
var res <- create R()
resources["r1"] <-> res
// `resources["r1"]` now contains the new resource.
// `res` now contains the old resource.
```

Resources cannot be moved into arrays and dictionaries multiple times,
as that would cause a duplication.

```bamboo,file=resource-array-duplication.bpl
let resource <- create R()

// Invalid: The resource variable `resource` can only be moved into the array once.
//
let resources <- [
    <-resource,
    <-resource
]
```

```bamboo,file=resource-dictionary-duplication.bpl
let resource <- create R()

// Invalid: The resource variable `resource` can only be moved into the dictionary once.
let resources <- {
    "res1": <-resource,
    "res2": <-resource
}
```

Resource arrays and dictionaries can be destroyed.

```bamboo,file=resource-array-destroy.bpl
let resources <- [
    <-create R(),
    <-create R()
]
destroy resources
```

```bamboo,file=resource-dictionary-destroy.bpl
let resources <- {
    "r1": <-create R(),
    "r2": <-create R()
}
destroy resources
```

The variable array functions like `append`, `insert`, and `remove` behave like for non-resource arrays.
Note however, that the result of the `remove` functions must be used.

```bamboo,file-resource-array-mutating-functions.bpl
let resources <- [<-create R()]
// `resources.length` is `1`

resources.append(<-create R())
// `resources.length` is `2`

let first <- resource.remove(at: 0)
// `resources.length` is `1`
destroy first

resources.insert(at: 0, <-create R())
// `resources.length` is `2`

// Invalid: The statement ignores the result of the call to `remove`,
// which would result in a loss.
resource.remove(at: 0)

destroy resources
```

The variable array function `contains` is not available, as it is impossible:
If the resource can be passed to the `contains` function, it is by definition not in the array.

The variable array function `concat` is not available, as it would result in the duplication of resources.

The dictionary functions like `insert` and `remove` behave like for non-resource dictionaries.
Note however, that the result of these functions must be used.

```bamboo,file-resource-dictionary-mutating-functions.bpl
let resources <- {"r1": <-create R()}
// `resources.length` is `1`

let first <- resource.remove(key: "r1")
// `resources.length` is `0`
destroy first

let old <- resources.insert(key: "r1", <-create R())
// `old` is nil, as there was no value for the key "r1"
// `resources.length` is `1`

let old2 <- resources.insert(key: "r1", <-create R())
// `old2` is the old value for the key "r1"
// `resources.length` is `2`

destroy old
destroy old2
destroy resources
```

### Unbound References / Nulls

There is **no** support for `null`.

### Inheritance and Abstract Types

There is **no** support for inheritance. Inheritance is a feature common in other programming languages, that allows including the fields and functions of one type in another type.

Instead, follow the "composition over inheritance" principle, the idea of composing functionality from multiple individual parts, rather than building an inheritance tree.

Furthermore, there is also **no** support for abstract types. An abstract type is a feature common in other programming languages, that prevents creating values of the type and only allows the creation of values of a subtype. In addition, abstract types may declare functions, but omit the implementation of them and instead require subtypes to implement them.

Instead, consider using [interfaces](#interfaces).

## Access control

> 🚧 Status: Access control is not implemented yet.

Access control allows making certain parts of the program accessible/visible and making other parts inaccessible/invisible.
Top-level declarations (variables, constants, functions, structures, resources, interfaces) and fields (in structures, and resources) are either private or public.

- **Private** means the declaration is only accessible/visible in the current and inner scopes.
  For example, a private field can only be accessed by functions of the type is part of,
  not by code that uses an instance of the type in an outer scope.

- **Public** means the declaration is accessible/visible in all scopes.
  This includes the current and inner scopes like for private, and the outer scopes.
  For example, a public field in a type can be accessed using the access syntax on an instance of the type in an outer scope.
  This does not allow the declaration to be publicly writable though.

**By default, everything is private.**

An element is made public by using the `pub` keyword.

The `(set)` suffix can be used to make variables also publicly writable.

To summarize the behavior for variable declarations, constant declarations, and fields:

| Declaration kind | Access modifier    | Read scope        | Write scope       |
|:-----------------|:-------------------|:------------------|:------------------|
| `let`            |                    | Current and inner | *None*            |
| `let`            | `pub`              | **All**           | *None*            |
| `var`            |                    | Current and inner | Current and inner |
| `var`            | `pub`              | **All**           | Current and inner |
| `var`            | `pub(set)`         | **All**           | **All**           |

To summarize the behavior for functions, structures, resources, and interfaces:

| Declaration kind                                                        | Access modifier       | Access scope      |
|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------|:------------------|
| `fun`, `struct`, `resource`, `struct interface`, `resource interface`   |                       | Current and inner |
| `fun`, `struct`, `resource`, `struct interface`, `resource interface`   | `pub`                 | **All**           |

```

some.d = 4

// Valid: can read publicly settable variable field in outer scope.
//

// Valid: can set publicly settable variable field in outer scope.
//
some.e = 5
```

## Interfaces

An interface is an abstract type that specifies the behavior of types that *implement* the interface.
Interfaces declare the required functions and fields, the access control for those declarations, and preconditions and postconditions that implementing types need to provide.

There are two kinds of interfaces:

- **Structure interfaces**: implemented by [structures](#structures)
- **Resource interfaces**: implemented by [resources](#resources)

Structure and resource types may implement multiple interfaces.

Interfaces consist of the function and field requirements that a type implementing the interface must provide implementations for.
Interface requirements, and therefore also their implementations, must always be at least public.

Variable field requirements may be annotated to require them to be publicly settable.

Function requirements consist of the name of the function, parameter types, an optional return type,
and optional preconditions and postconditions.

Field requirements consist of the name and the type of the field.
Field requirements may optionally declare a getter requirement and a setter requirement, each with preconditions and postconditions.

Calling functions with preconditions and postconditions on interfaces instead of concrete implementations can improve the security of a program,
as it ensures that even if implementations change, some aspects of them will always hold.

### Interface Declaration

Interfaces are declared using the `struct` or `resource` keyword,
followed by the `interface` keyword,
the name of the interface,
and the requirements, which must be enclosed in opening and closing braces.

Field requirements can be annotated to require the implementation to be a variable field, by using the `var` keyword;
require the implementation to be a constant field, by using the `let` keyword;
or the field requirement may specify nothing,
in which case the implementation may either be a variable field, a constant field, or a synthetic field.

Field requirements and function requirements must specify the required level of access.
The access must be at least be public, so the `pub` keyword must be provided.
Variable field requirements can be specified to also be publicly settable by using the `pub(set)` keyword.

The special type `Self` can be used to refer to the type implementing the interface.

```bamboo,file=interface-declaration.bpl
// Declare a resource interface for a fungible token.
// Only resources can implement this resource interface.
//
resource interface FungibleToken {

    // Require the implementing type to provide a field for the balance
    // that is readable in all scopes (`pub`).
    //
    // Neither the `var` keyword, nor the `let` keyword is used,
    // so the field may be implemented as either a variable field,
    // a constant field, or a synthetic field.
    //
    // The read balance must always be positive.
    //
    // NOTE: no requirement is made for the kind of field,
    // it can be either variable or constant in the implementation.
    //
    pub balance: Int {
        set(newBalance) {
            pre {
                newBalance >= 0:
                    "Balances are always non-negative"
            }
        }
        get {
            post {
                result >= 0:
                    "Balances are always non-negative"
            }
        }
    }

    // Require the implementing type to provide an initializer that
    // given the initial balance, must initialize the balance field.
    //
    init(balance: Int) {
        pre {
            balance >= 0:
                "Balances are always non-negative"
        }
        post {
            self.balance == balance:
                "the balance must be initialized to the initial balance"
        }

        // NOTE: The declaration contains no implementation code.
    }

    // Require the implementing type to provide a function that is
    // callable in all scopes, which withdraws an amount from
    // this fungible token and returns the withdrawn amount as
    // a new fungible token.
    //
    // The given amount must be positive and the function implementation
    // must add the amount to the balance.
    //
    // The function must return a new fungible token.
    //
    // NOTE: `<-Self` is the resource type implementing this interface.
    //
    pub fun withdraw(amount: Int): <-Self {
        pre {
            amount > 0:
                "the amount must be positive"
            amount <= self.balance:
                "insufficient funds: the amount must be smaller or equal to the balance"
        }
        post {
            self.balance == before(self.balance) - amount:
                "the amount must be deducted from the balance"
        }

        // NOTE: The declaration contains no implementation code.
    }

    // Require the implementing type to provide a function that is
    // callable in all scopes, which deposits a fungible token
    // into this fungible token.
    //
    // The given token must be of the same type – a deposit of another
    // type is not possible.
    //
    // No precondition is required to check the given token's balance
    // is positive, as this condition is already ensured by
    // the field requirement.
    //
    // NOTE: the first parameter has the type `<-Self`,
    // i.e. the resource type implementing this interface.
    //
    pub fun deposit(_ token: <-Self) {
        post {
            self.balance == before(self.balance) + token.balance:
                "the amount must be added to the balance"
        }

        // NOTE: The declaration contains no implementation code.
    }
}
```

Note that the required initializer and functions do not have any executable code.

Interfaces can only be declared globally, i.e. not inside of functions.

### Interface Implementation

Declaring that a type implements (conforms) to an interface
is done in the type declaration of the composite data type (e.g., structure, resource):
The kind and the name of the composite data type is followed by a colon (`:`)
and the name of one or more interfaces that the composite data type implements.

This will tell the checker to enforce any requirements from the specified interfaces onto the declared type.

A type implements (conforms to) an interface if it provides field declarations
for all fields required by the interface and provides implementations for all functions
required by the interface.

The field declarations in the implementing type must match the field requirements
in the interface in terms of name, type, and declaration kind (e.g. constant, variable)
if given. For example, an interface may require a field with a certain name and type,
but leaves it to the implementation what kind the field is.

The function implementations must match the function requirements in the interface
in terms of name, parameter argument labels, parameter types, and the return type.

```bamboo,file=interface-implementation.bpl
// Declare a resource named `ExampleToken` that has to implement
// the `FungibleToken` interface.
//
// It has a variable field named `balance`, that can be written
// by functions of the type, but outer scopes can only read it.
//
resource ExampleToken: FungibleToken {

    // Implement the required field `balance` for the `FungibleToken` interface.
    // The interface does not specify if the field must be variable, constant,
    // so in order for this type (`ExampleToken`) to be able to write to the field,
    // but limit outer scopes to only read from the field, it is declared variable,
    // and only has public access (non-settable).
    //
    pub var balance: Int

    // Implement the required initializer for the `FungibleToken` interface:
    // accept an initial balance and initialize the `balance` field.
    //
    // This implementation satisfies the required postcondition.
    //
    // NOTE: the postcondition declared in the interface
    // does not have to be repeated here in the implementation.
    //
    init(balance: Int) {
        self.balance = balance
    }

    // Implement the required function named `withdraw` of the interface
    // `FungibleToken`, that withdraws an amount from the token's balance.
    //
    // The function must be public.
    //
    // This implementation satisfies the required postcondition.
    //
    // NOTE: neither the precondition nor the postcondition declared
    // in the interface have to be repeated here in the implementation.
    //
    pub fun withdraw(amount: Int): <-ExampleToken {
        self.balance = self.balance - amount
        return create ExampleToken(balance: amount)
    }

    // Implement the required function named `deposit` of the interface
    // `FungibleToken`, that deposits the amount from the given token
    // to this token.
    //
    // The function must be public.
    //
    // NOTE: the type of the parameter is `<-ExampleToken`,
    // i.e., only a token of the same type can be deposited.
    //
    // This implementation satisfies the required postconditions.
    //
    // NOTE: neither the precondition nor the postcondition declared
    // in the interface have to be repeated here in the implementation.
    //
    pub fun deposit(_ token: <-ExampleToken) {
        self.balance = self.balance + token.balance
        destroy token
    }
}

// Declare a constant which has type `ExampleToken`,
// and is initialized with such an example token.
//
let token <- create ExampleToken(balance: 100)

// Withdraw 10 units from the token.
//
// The amount satisfies the precondition of the `withdraw` function
// in the `FungibleToken` interface.
//
// Invoking a function of a resource does not destroy the resource,
// so the resource `token` is still valid after the call of `withdraw`.
//
let withdrawn <- token.withdraw(amount: 10)

// The postcondition of the `withdraw` function in the `FungibleToken`
// interface ensured the balance field of the token was updated properly.
//
// `token.balance` is `90`
// `withdrawn.balance` is `10`

// Deposit the withdrawn token into another one.
let receiver: ExampleToken <- // ...
receiver.deposit(<-withdrawn)

// Run-time error: The precondition of function `withdraw` in interface
// `FungibleToken` fails, the program aborts: the parameter `amount`
// is larger than the field `balance` (100 > 90).
//
token.withdraw(amount: 100)

// Withdrawing tokens so that the balance is zero does not destroy the resource.
// The resource has to be destroyed explicitly.
//
token.withdraw(amount: 90)
```

The access level for variable fields in an implementation may be less restrictive than the interface requires.
For example, an interface may require a field to be at least public (i.e. the `pub` keyword is specified),
and an implementation may provide a variable field which is public, but also publicly settable (the `pub(set)` keyword is specified).

```bamboo
struct interface AnInterface {
    // Require the implementing type to provide a publicly readable
    // field named `a` that has type `Int`. It may be a constant field,
    // a variable field, or a synthetic field.
    //
    pub a: Int
}

struct AnImplementation: AnInterface {
    // Declare a publicly settable variable field named `a`that has type `Int`.
    // This implementation satisfies the requirement for interface `AnInterface`:
    // The field is at least publicly readable, but this implementation also
    // allows the field to be written to in all scopes.
    //
    pub(set) var a: Int

    init(a: Int) {
        self.a = a
    }
}

```

### Interface Type

Interfaces are types.
Values implementing an interface can be used as initial values for constants and variables that have the interface as their type.

```bamboo,file=interface-type.bpl
// Declare an interface named `Shape`.
//
// Require implementing types to provide a field which returns the area,
// and a function which scales the shape by a given factor.
//
struct interface Shape {
    pub area: Int
    pub fun scale(factor: Int)
}

// Declare a structure named `Square` the implements the `Shape` interface.
//
struct Square: Shape {
    // In addition to the required fields from the interface,
    // the type can also declare additional fields.
    //
    pub var length: Int

    // Provided the field `area`  which is required to conform
    // to the interface `Shape`.
    //
    // Since `area` was not declared as a constant, variable,
    // field in the interface, it can be declared.
    //
    pub synthetic area: Int {
        get {
            return self.length * self.length
        }
    }

    pub init(length: Int) {
        self.length = length
    }

    // Provided the implementation of the function `scale`
    // which is required to conform to the interface `Shape`.
    //
    pub fun scale(factor: Int) {
        self.length = self.length * factor
    }
}

// Declare a structure named `Rectangle` that also implements the `Shape` interface.
//
struct Rectangle: Shape {
    pub var width: Int
    pub var height: Int

    // Provided the field `area  which is required to conform
    // to the interface `Shape`.
    //
    pub synthetic area: Int {
        get {
            return self.width * self.height
        }
    }

    pub init(width: Int, height: Int) {
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
    }

    // Provided the implementation of the function `scale`
    // which is required to conform to the interface `Shape`.
    //
    pub fun scale(factor: Int) {
        self.width = self.width * factor
        self.height = self.height * factor
    }
}

// Declare a constant that has type `Shape`, which has a value that has type `Rectangle`.
//
var shape: Shape = Rectangle(width: 10, height: 20)
```

Values implementing an interface are assignable to variables that have the interface as their type.

```bamboo,file=interface-type-assignment.bpl
// Assign a value of type `Square` to the variable `shape` that has type `Shape`.
//
shape = Square(length: 30)

// Invalid: cannot initialize a constant that has type `Rectangle`.
// with a value that has type `Square`.
//
let rectangle: Rectangle = Square(length: 10)
```

Fields declared in an interface can be accessed and functions declared in an interface can be called on values of a type that implements the interface.

```bamboo,file=interface-type-fields-and-functions.bpl
// Declare a constant which has the type `Shape`.
// and is initialized with a value that has type `Rectangle`.
//
let shape: Shape = Rectangle(width: 2, height: 3)

// Access the field `area` declared in the interface `Shape`.
//
shape.area  // is `6`

// Call the function `scale` declared in the interface `Shape`.
//
shape.scale(factor: 3)

shape.area  // is `54`
```

### Interface Implementation Requirements

Interfaces can require implementing types to also implement other interfaces of the same kind.
Interface implementation requirements can be declared by following the interface name with a colon (`:`)
and one or more names of interfaces of the same kind, separated by commas.

```bamboo,file=interface-implementation-requirement.bpl
// Declare a structure interface named `Shape`.
//
struct interface Shape {}

// Declare a structure interface named `Polygon`.
// Require implementing types to also implement the structure interface `Shape`.
//
struct interface Polygon: Shape {}

// Declare a structure named `Hexagon` that implements the `Polygon` interface.
// This also is required to implement the `Shape` interface,
// because the `Polygon` interface requires it.
//
struct Hexagon: Polygon {}

```

### Interface Nesting

Interfaces can be arbitrarily nested.
Declaring an interface inside another does not require implementing types of the outer interface to provide an implementation of the inner interfaces.

```bamboo,file=interface-nesting.bpl
// Declare a resource interface `OuterInterface`, which declares
// a nested structure interface named `InnerInterface`.
//
// Resources implementing `OuterInterface` do not need to provide
// an implementation of `InnerInterface`.
//
// Structures may just implement `InnerInterface`.
//
resource interface OuterInterface {

    struct interface InnerInterface {}
}

// Declare a resource named `SomeOuter` that implements the interface `OuterInterface`
//
// The resource is not required to implement `OuterInterface.InnerInterface`.
//
resource SomeOuter: OuterInterface {}

// Declare a structure named `SomeInner` that implements `InnerInterface`,
// which is nested in interface `OuterInterface`.
//
struct SomeInner: OuterInterface.InnerInterface {}

```

### Nested Type Requirements

Interfaces can require implementing types to provide concrete nested types.
For example, a resource interface may require an implementing type to provide a resource type.

```bamboo,file=interface-nested-type-requirement.bpl
// Declare a resource interface named `FungibleToken`.
//
// Require implementing types to provide a resource type named `Vault`
// which must have a field named `balance`.
//
resource interface FungibleToken {

    pub resource Vault {
        pub balance: Int
    }
}

// Declare a resource named `ExampleToken` that implements the `FungibleToken` interface.
//
// The nested type `Vault` must be provided to conform to the interface.
//
resource ExampleToken: FungibleToken {

    pub resource Vault {
        pub var balance: Int

        init(balance: Int) {
            self.balance = balance
        }
    }
}

```

### `Equatable` Interface

> 🚧 Status: The `Equatable` interface is not implemented yet.

An equatable type is a type that can be compared for equality. Types are equatable when they  implement the `Equatable` interface.

Equatable types can be compared for equality using the equals operator (`==`) or inequality using the unequals operator (`!=`).

Most of the built-in types are equatable, like booleans and integers. Arrays are equatable when their elements are equatable. Dictionaries are equatable when their values are equatable.

To make a type equatable the `Equatable` interface must be implemented, which requires the implementation of the function `equals`, which accepts another value that the given value should be compared for equality. Note that the parameter type is `Self`, i.e., the other value must have the same type as the implementing type.

```bamboo,file=equatable.bpl
struct interface Equatable {
    pub fun equals(_ other: Self): Bool
}
```

```bamboo,file=equatable-impl.bpl
// Declare a struct named `Cat`, which has one field named `id`
// that has type `Int`, i.e., the identifier of the cat.
//
// `Cat` also will implement the interface `Equatable`
// to allow cats to be compared for equality.
//
struct Cat: Equatable {
    pub let id: Int

    init(id: Int) {
        self.id = id
    }

    pub fun equals(_ other: Self): Bool {
        // Cats are equal if their identifier matches.
        //
        return other.id == self.id
    }
}

Cat(1) == Cat(2)  // is `false`
Cat(3) == Cat(3)  // is `true`
```

### `Hashable` Interface

> 🚧 Status: The `Hashable` interface is not implemented yet.

A hashable type is a type that can be hashed to an integer hash value,
i.e., it is distilled into a value that is used as evidence of inequality.
Types are hashable when they implement the `Hashable` interface.

Hashable types can be used as keys in dictionaries.

Hashable types must also be equatable, i.e., they must also implement the `Equatable` interface.
This is because the hash value is only evidence for inequality:
two values that have different hash values are guaranteed to be unequal.
However, if the hash values of two values are the same,
then the two values could still be unequal and just happen to hash to the same hash value.
In that case equality still needs to be determined through an equality check.
Without `Equatable`, values could be added to a dictionary,
but it would not be possible to retrieve them.

Most of the built-in types are hashable, like booleans and integers.
Arrays are hashable when their elements are hashable.
Dictionaries are hashable when their values are equatable.

Hashing a value means passing its essential components into a hash function.
Essential components are those that are used in the type's implementation of `Equatable`.

If two values are equal because their `equals` function returns true,
then the implementation must return the same integer hash value for each of the two values.

The implementation must also consistently return the same integer hash value during the execution of the program when the essential components have not changed.
The integer hash value must not necessarily be the same across multiple executions.

```bamboo,file=hashable.bpl
struct interface Hashable: Equatable {
    pub hashValue: Int
}
```

```bamboo,file=hashable-impl.bpl
// Declare a structure named `Point` with two fields
// named `x` and `y` that have type `Int`.
//
// `Point` is declared to implement the `Hashable` interface,
// which also means it needs to implement the `Equatable` interface.
//
struct Point: Hashable {

    pub(set) var x: Int
    pub(set) var y: Int

    init(x: Int, y: Int) {
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    }

    // Implementing the function `equals` will allow points to be compared
    // for equality and satisfies the `Equatable` interface.
    //
    pub fun equals(_ other: Self): Bool {
        // Points are equal if their coordinates match.
        //
        // The essential components are therefore the fields `x` and `y`,
        // which must be used in the implementation of the field requirement
        // `hashValue` of the `Hashable` interface.
        //
        return other.x == self.x
            && other.y == self.y
    }

    // Providing an implementation for the hash value field
    // satisfies the `Hashable` interface.
    //
    pub synthetic hashValue: Int {
        get {
            // Calculate a hash value based on the essential components,
            // the fields `x` and `y`.
            //
            var hash = 7
            hash = 31 * hash + self.x
            hash = 31 * hash + self.y
            return hash
        }
    }
}
```

## Attestations

> 🚧 Status: Attestations are not implemented yet.

Attestations are values that prove ownership without giving any control over it. They can be created for resources to show that they exists.

Attestations are useful in cases where ownership of some asset/resource should be demonstrated to potentially untrusted code.

As an analogy, a bank statement is a proof of ownership of money.
However, unlike a bank statement, an attestation is "live", i.e. it is not just a snapshot at the time it was created,
but it reflects the current state of the underlying resource.

Attestations can only be created from resources, i.e., they cannot be forged by parties who do not have ownership of the resource,
and can be safely handed to untrusted parties.

An attestation reflects the current state of a resource. The state is read-only, so the resource that is referred to cannot be modified.
It is not possible to change the ownership of a resource through an attestation, or store an attestation.

Attestations of resources are created using the `@` operator.
Attestation types have the name of the resource type, prefixed with the `@` symbol.

```bamboo,file=attestations.bpl
// Declare a resource named `Token`.
//
resource Token {}

// Create a new instance of the resource type `Token`.
//
let token <- create Token()

// Declare a constant named `attestation` that has the attestation type `@Token`,
// and has an attestation for the token value as its initial value.
//
let attestation: @Token = @token
```

Like resources, attestations are associated with an [account](#accounts).

## Accounts

```bamboo
struct interface Account {
    address: Address
    storage: Storage  // explained below
}
```

## Account Storage

All accounts have a `storage` object which contains the stored values of the account.

Account storage is a key-value store where the **keys are types**.
The stored value must be a subtype of the type it is keyed by.
This means that if the type `Vault` is used as a key,
the value must be a value that has the type `Vault` or is a subtype of `Vault`.

The index operator `[]` is used for both reading and writing stored values.

```bamboo
// Declare a resource named `Counter`.
//
resource Counter {
    pub var count: Int

    pub init(count: Int) {
        self.count = count
    }
}

// Create a new instance of the resource type `Counter` and move it
// into the storage of the account.
//
// In this example the account is available as the constant `account`.
//
// The type `Counter` is used as the key to refer to the stored value.
//
account.storage[Counter] <- create Counter(count: 0)
```

## Transactions

> 🚧 Status: The usage of external types is not implemented yet.

Transactions are objects that are signed by one or more [accounts](#accounts) and are sent to the chain to interact with it.

Transactions are structured as such:

Before the transaction declaration, there can be imports of any necessary local or external types and interfaces that are needed, using the `import` keyword, followed by `from`, and then followed by the location.
If importing a local file's type definition, the location will be the path to the file that has the definition.
If importing an external type that has been published by another account, that account's `Address` must be given.

Importing an external resource does not move it from the account that holds it.
It simply imports the type definition so that it can be used within a transaction.

```bamboo,file=imports.bpl
// Import the type `Counter` from a local file.
//
import Counter from "examples/counter.bpl"

// Import the type `Counter` from an external account.
//
import Counter from 0x299F20A29311B9248F12
```

Next is definitions of any new types that will be used or deployed within the transaction.
These are kind of like global constants or variables.

Next is the body of the transaction, which is broken into three main phases:
Preparation, execution, and postconditions, only in that order.
Each phase is a block of code that executes sequentially.

- The **prepare phase** acts like the initializer in a composite data type, i.e., it initializes fields that can then be used in the execution phase.
  The preparer has the permissions to read from and write to the storage of all the accounts that signed the transaction.

- The **execute phase** is where all interaction with external contracts happens.
  This usually involves interacting with contracts with public types and functions that are deployed in other accounts.

- The **postcondition phase** is where the transaction can check that its functionality was executed correctly.

Transactions are declared using the `transaction` keyword.

Within the transaction, but before the prepare phase, any number of constants and/or variables can be declared. These are valid within the entire scope of the transaction.

The preparer is declared using the `prepare` keyword and the execution phase can be declared using the `execute` keyword.
The `post` section can be used to declare postconditions.

```bamboo,file=transaction-declaration.bpl
// Optional: Importing external types from other accounts using `import`.

transaction {

    // Optional: type declarations and fields, which must be initialized in `prepare`.

    // The preparer needs to have as many account parameters
    // as there are signers for the transaction.
    //
    prepare(signer1: Account) {
        // ...
    }

    execute {
        // ...
    }

    post {
        // ...
    }
}
```

### Deployment

Transactions can deploy resources and resource interfaces to the storage of any of the signing accounts.  Here is an example of a resource interface that will be deployed to an account.  Imagine it is in a file named `FungibleToken.bpl`.

```bamboo,file=fungible-token-interface.bpl
// Declare a resource interface for a fungible token.
//
// It requires implementing types to provide a resource implementation named `Vault`,
// which needs to implement the interfaces `Provider` and `Receiver`.
//
pub resource interface Provider {

    pub fun withdraw(amount: Int): <-Vault {
        pre {
            amount > 0:
                "withdrawal amount must be positive"
        }
        post {
            result.balance == amount:
                "incorrect amount returned"
        }
    }
}

pub resource interface Receiver {
    pub fun deposit(vault: <-Vault)
}

// `Vault` is an interface that implements both `Provider` and `Receiver`.
//
pub resource interface Vault: Provider, Receiver {

    pub balance: Int {
        set(newBalance) {
            post {
                newBalance >= 0:
                    "Balances are always non-negative"
            }
        }
        get {
            post {
                result >= 0:
                    "Balances are always non-negative"
            }
        }
    }

    init(balance: Int) {
        post {
            self.balance == balance:
                "the balance must be initialized to the initial balance"
        }
    }

    pub fun withdraw(amount: Int): <-Self {
        pre {
            amount <= self.balance:
                "insufficient funds: the amount must be smaller or equal to the balance"
        }
        post {
            self.balance == before(self.balance) - amount:
                "Incorrect amount removed"
        }
    }

    pub fun deposit(vault: <-Self) {
        post {
            self.balance == before(self.balance) + vault.balance:
                "the amount must be added to the balance"
        }
    }
}
```

The transaction will import the above file to use it in the code.
Transactions can refer to local code with the `import` keyword,
followed by the name of the type, the `from` keyword,
and the string literal for the path of the file which contains the code of the type.

<!-- TODO:
     move explanation for using statement into separate section?
     also see below for version referring to deployed code with an address
-->

The preparer can use the signing account's `deploy` function to deploy
the resource interface.  This essentially stores the resource interface in the account's `types` object so it can be used again.

Once deployed, the resource interface is available in the account's `types` object, which is how the deployed types are accessed.

When deploying a resource or interface to an account, it is private by default, just like fields and functions within the resources.  This is a second layer of access control that BPL adds to ensure that certain interfaces and resources are not available to anyone. The `publish` action can be used to override this access control and make certain subsets of the resources public.

The `publish` operator is used to make the resource or interface type publicly available.  After a resource or interface is published, any account can import it into a transaction and use it to import the type, call the functions defined in the resource at the owners address, or call the functions in a published interface in a resource that implements it.

```bamboo,file=deploy-resource-interface.bpl
// Import the resource interface type `Vault`
// from the local file "FungibleToken.bpl".
//
import Vault from "FungibleToken.bpl"

// Define a transaction which deploys the code for the resource interface `Vault`,
// and makes the deployed interface type publicly available.
//
transaction {

    prepare(signer: Account) {
        // Deploy the  resource interface type `Vault`
        // in the signing account.
        //
        signer.deploy(Vault)

        // Make the deployed type publicly available,
        // so anyone can import the `Vault` interface from the account.
        //
        publish signer.types[Vault]
    }
}
```

Now, anybody can import the vault interface from the account storage if they want to use it for their resources.

Just like resource interfaces it is possible to deploy resources.  Imagine this resource definition below is also in the local file `FungibleToken.bpl` that was used above.

```bamboo,file=example-token.bpl
// Declare a resource named `FungibleToken` which implements
// the resource interface `Vault`.
//
resource FungibleToken: Vault {

        pub var balance: Int

        init(balance: Int) {
            self.balance = balance
        }

        pub fun withdraw(amount: Int): <-Vault {
            self.balance = self.balance - amount
            return create Vault(balance: amount)
        }

        pub fun deposit(_ vault: <-Vault) {
            self.balance = self.balance + vault.balance
            destroy vault
        }
}
```

Now, in the same transaction that was used to deploy and publish the interface, the resource can also be stored and published.

```bamboo,file=deploy-resource.bpl
import FungibleToken from "FungibleToken.bpl"

// Execute a transaction which deploys the code for the resource `FungibleToken`,
// and makes the deployed type publicly available.
//
transaction {

    prepare(signer: Account) {
        signer.deploy(Vault)
        publish signer.types[Vault]

        signer.deploy(FungibleToken)
        signer.storage[FungibleToken] <- create FungibleToken(balance: 100)
        publish signer.types[FungibleToken]
    }
}
```

Now, the `Vault` and the `FungibleToken` types are deployed to the account and published so that anyone who wants to use them or interact with them can easily do so by importing them.

In many scenarios, publishing the entire interface for the resource may be necessary because everyone might want to be able to access all functionality of the type.  In most situations though, including this one, it is important to expose only a subset of the functionality of the resources because some of the functionality should only be visible to the owner.  In this example, the withdraw function should only be callable by the account owner, so instead of publishing the Vault and FungibleToken interface,  the receiver interface is the only one that should be published.

The next section will show how an account can deploy its own instance of `FungibleToken` based on a published external type and publish the correct interface.

### Interacting with Deployed Resources

<!-- TODO:
     move explanation for using statement into separate section?
     also see above for version referring to local code with a path
-->

In addition to storing resources it is also possible to store references to **stored** resources or even other references.
References can only be keyed by (and therefore accessed through) **resource interfaces**.

References are created by using the `&` operator, followed by the stored resource or reference,
the `as` operator, and the resource interface type.

```bamboo,file=setup-transaction.bpl
// Import the resource type `FungibleToken`, which was "deployed" above,
// from address 0x42.
//
import FungibleToken from 0x42

// Execute a transaction which creates a new example token vault
// for the signing account.
//
transaction {

    prepare(signer: Account) {
        // Create a new example token vault for the signing account.
        //
        // NOTE: the vault is not publicly accessible.
        //
        signer.storage[FungibleToken] <- create FungibleToken()

        // Store two storage references in the signing account:
        // One reference to the stored vault, keyed by the resource
        // interface `Provider`, and another reference to the stored vault,
        // keyed by the resource interface `Provider`.
        //
        signer.storage[FungibleToken.Provider] =
            &signer.storage[FungibleToken.Vault] as FungibleToken.Provider

        signer.storage[FungibleToken.Receiver] =
            &signer.storage[FungibleToken.Vault] as FungibleToken.Receiver

        // Publish only the receiver so it can be accessed publicly.
        //
        // NOTE: Neither the vault nor the publisher are published,
        // so that only the owner has access to it.
        //
        publish signer.storage[FungibleToken.Receiver]
    }
}
```

```bamboo,file=send-transaction.bpl
// Import the resource type `FungibleToken` deployed at example address 0x42.
//
import FungibleToken from 0x42

// Execute a transaction which sends five coins from one account to another.
//
// The transaction fails unless there is a `FungibleToken.Provider` available
// for the sending account and there is a public `FungibleToken.Receiver`
// available for the recipient account.
//
// Only a signature from the sender is required.
// No signature from the recipient is required, as the receiver
// is published/publicly available (if it exists for the recipient).
//
transaction {

    let sentFunds: FungibleToken.Vault

    prepare(signer: Account) {

        // Call the stored provider's withdraw function,
        // withdraw 5 tokens, and move the them to the field `sentFunds`.
        //
        // As the access is performed in the preparer of the transaction,
        // the unpublished reference `FungibleToken.Provider`
        // can be accessed (if it exists; otherwise the transaction aborts).
        //
        self.sentFunds <- signer.storage[FungibleToken.Provider].withdraw(amount: 5)
    }

    execute {
        // The recipient account
        //
        let recipient: Account = // ...

        // Deposit the amount withdrawn from the signer in the recipient receivr,
        // which is assumed to be stored in the recipient account.
        // If the recipient has no receiver the transaction aborts.
        //
        recipient.storage[ExampleToken.Receiver].deposit(vault: <-self.sentFunds)
    }
}
```

## Built-in Functions

### Transaction information

There is currently no built-in function that allows getting the address of the signers of a transaction, the current block number, or timestamp.  These are being worked on.

### `panic`

```bamboo
fun panic(_ message: String): Never
```

Terminates the program unconditionally and reports a message which explains why the unrecoverable error occurred.

#### Example

```bamboo
let optionalAccount: Account? = // ...
let account = optionalAccount ?? panic("missing account")
```

### `assert`

```bamboo
fun assert(_ condition: Bool, message: String)
```

Terminates the program if the given condition is false, and reports a message which explains how the condition is false. Use this function for internal sanity checks.

The message argument is optional.
