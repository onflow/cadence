title: Imports
---

Programs can import declarations (types, functions, variables, etc.) from other programs.

Imports are declared using the `import` keyword.

It can either be followed by a location, which imports all declarations;
or it can be followed by the names of the declarations that should be imported,
followed by the `from` keyword, and then followed by the location.

If importing a local file, the location is a string literal, and the path to the file.
Deployment of code with file imports requires the usage for the [Flow CLI](/flow-cli).

If importing an external type in a different account,
the location is an address literal, and the address
of the account where the declarations are deployed to and published.

```cadence
// Import the type `Counter` from a local file.
//
import Counter from "./examples/counter.cdc"

// Import the type `Counter` from an external account.
//
import Counter from 0x299F20A29311B9248F12
```
