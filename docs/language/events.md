title: Events
---

Events are special values that can be emitted during the execution of a program.

An event type can be declared with the `event` keyword.

```cadence
event FooEvent(x: Int, y: Int)
```

The syntax of an event declaration is similar to that of
a [function declaration](../functions#function-declarations);
events contain named parameters, each of which has an optional argument label.

Event parameters may only have a valid event parameter type.
Valid types are boolean, string, integer, arrays and dictionaries of these types,
and structures where all fields have a valid event parameter type.
Resource types are not allowed, because when a resource is used as an argument, it is moved.

Events can only be declared within a [contract](../contracts) body.
Events cannot be declared globally or within resource or struct types.

```cadence
// Invalid: An event cannot be declared globally
//
event GlobalEvent(field: Int)

pub contract Events {
    // Event with explicit argument labels
    //
    event BarEvent(labelA fieldA: Int, labelB fieldB: Int)

    // Invalid: A resource type is not allowed to be used
    // because it would be moved and lost
    //
    event ResourceEvent(resourceField: @Vault)
}

```

### Emitting events

To emit an event from a program, use the `emit` statement:

```cadence
pub contract Events {
    event FooEvent(x: Int, y: Int)

    // Event with argument labels
    event BarEvent(labelA fieldA: Int, labelB fieldB: Int)

    fun events() {
        emit FooEvent(x: 1, y: 2)

        // Emit event with explicit argument labels
        // Note that the emitted event will only contain the field names,
        // not the argument labels used at the invocation site.
        emit FooEvent(labelA: 1, labelB: 2)
    }
}
```

Emitting events has the following restrictions:

- Events can only be invoked in an `emit` statement.

  This means events cannot be assigned to variables or used as function parameters.

- Events can only be emitted from the location in which they are declared.
