#-## Intwoduction 

The C-Cadence (o^ ^o)/ *dances nervously* P-Pwogwamming Wanguage is a nyew high-wevew pwogwamming wanguage 
intended (╬ Ò﹏Ó) *giggles shyly* f-fow smawt contwact d-devewopment. 

The wanguage's g-goaws a-awe, in owdew of i-impowtance: 

(✧ω✧) *teleports behind you* --- **Safety and secuwity**: 
Pwovide a stwong static t-type s-system, design by contwact (pweconditions and postconditions), 
and wesouwces (inspiwed by w-winyeaw types). 

(✧ω✧) *teleports behind you* --- **Auditabiwity**: 
Focus on weadabiwity: Make it easy to vewify what t-the code is doing, 
and make intentions e-expwicit, a-at a smaww cost of vewbosity. 

(✧ω✧) *teleports behind you* --- **Simpwicity**: Focus on devewopew p-pwoductivity and u-usabiwity: 
Make it easy to wwite code, pwovide g-good t-toowing. 

#-## Tewminyowogy 

In this document, t-the fowwowing tewminyowogy is used to descwibe s-syntax 
ow behaviow that is nyot awwowed in t-the wanguage: 

(✧ω✧) *teleports behind you* --- `Invawid` means that t-the invawid pwogwam wiww nyot even be awwowed to wun. 
The pwogwam ewwow is detected and wepowted s-staticawwy by t-the t-type c-checkew. 

(✧ω✧) *teleports behind you* --- `Wun-time e-ewwow` means that t-the e-ewwonyeous pwogwam wiww wun, 
but (＃￣ω￣) *hugs tightly* b-bad behaviow wiww wesuwt in t-the execution of t-the pwogwam being abowted. 

#-## Syntax and Behaviow 

Much of t-the wanguage's s-syntax is inspiwed by Swift, Kotwin, and TypeScwipt. 

Much of t-the s-syntax, types, and standawd wibwawy is inspiwed by Swift, 
which popuwawized e.g. optionyaws, {{ (>_<) }} *leans over* a-awgument w-wabews, 
and pwovides safe handwing of integews and stwings. 

Wesouwces awe b-based on w-winyeaw t-types which wewe popuwawized by W-Wust. 

Events awe inspiwed by Sowidity. 

**Discwaimew:** In weaw C-Cadence code, (＾▽＾') *cuddles you* a-aww t-type definyitions and code 
(* ^ ω ^) *screams* m-must be d-decwawed and c-containyed in [contwacts](contwacts) ow [twansactions](twansactions), 
but we o-omit these containyews in (-_-) *dances nervously* e-exampwes (╬ Ò﹏Ó) *giggles shyly* f-fow s-simpwicity.
