## panic
`fun panic(_ message: String): Never`

  Terminates the program unconditionally
  and reports a message which explains why the unrecoverable error occurred.

  ```cadence
  let optionalAccount: AuthAccount? = // ...
  let account = optionalAccount ?? panic("missing account")
  ```

## assert

`fun assert(_ condition: Bool, message: String)`

  Terminates the program if the given condition is false,
  and reports a message which explains how the condition is false.
  Use this function for internal sanity checks.

  The message argument is optional.

## unsafeRandom

`fun unsafeRandom(): UInt64`

  Returns a pseudo-random number.

  NOTE: The use of this function is unsafe if not used correctly.

  Follow [best practices](https://github.com/ConsenSys/smart-contract-best-practices/blob/051ec2e42a66f4641d5216063430f177f018826e/docs/recommendations.md#remember-that-on-chain-data-is-public)
  to prevent security issues when using this function.

## RLP

RLP (Recursive Length Prefix) serialization allows the encoding of arbitrarily nested arrays of binary data.

Cadence provides RLP decoding functions in the built-in `RLP` contract, which does not need to be imported.

- `fun decodeString(_ input: [UInt8]): [UInt8]`

  Decodes an RLP-encoded byte array (called string in the context of RLP).
  The byte array should only contain of a single encoded value for a string; if the encoded value type does not match, or it has trailing unnecessary bytes, the program aborts.
  If any error is encountered while decoding, the program aborts.


- `fun decodeList(_ input: [UInt8]): [[UInt8]]`

  Decodes an RLP-encoded list into an array of RLP-encoded items.
  Note that this function does not recursively decode, so each element of the resulting array is RLP-encoded data.
  The byte array should only contain of a single encoded value for a list; if the encoded value type does not match, or it has trailing unnecessary bytes, the program aborts.
  If any error is encountered while decoding, the program aborts.
