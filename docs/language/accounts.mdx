title: Accounts
---

Every account can be accessed through two types, `PublicAccount` and `AuthAccount`.

## `PublicAccount`

**Public Account** objects have the type `PublicAccount`,
which represents the publicly available portion of an account.

  ```cadence
  struct PublicAccount {

      let address: Address
      // The FLOW balance of the default vault of this account
      let balance: UFix64
      // The FLOW balance of the default vault of this account that is available to be moved
      let availableBalance: UFix64
      // Amount of storage used by the account, in bytes
      let storageUsed: UInt64
      // storage capacity of the account, in bytes
      let storageCapacity: UInt64

      // Contracts deployed to the account
      let contracts: PublicAccount.Contracts

      // Keys assigned to the account
      let keys: PublicAccount.Keys

      // Storage operations

      fun getCapability<T>(_ path: PublicPath): Capability<T>
      fun getLinkTarget(_ path: CapabilityPath): Path?

      struct Contracts {

          let names: [String]

          fun get(name: String): DeployedContract?
      }

      struct Keys {
          // Returns the key at the given index, if it exists.
          // Revoked keys are always returned, but they have \`isRevoked\` field set to true.
          fun get(keyIndex: Int): AccountKey?
      }
  }
  ```

  Any code can get the `PublicAccount` for an account address
  using the built-in `getAccount` function:

  ```cadence
  fun getAccount(_ address: Address): PublicAccount
  ```

## `AuthAccount`

**Authorized Account** object have the type `AuthAccount`,
which represents the authorized portion of an account.

Access to an `AuthAccount` means having full access to its [storage](#account-storage),
public keys, and code.

Only [signed transactions](transactions) can get the `AuthAccount` for an account.
For each signer of the transaction that signs as an authorizer, the corresponding `AuthAccount` object is passed
to the `prepare` phase of the transaction.

  ```cadence
  struct AuthAccount {

      let address: Address
      // The FLOW balance of the default vault of this account
      let balance: UFix64
      // The FLOW balance of the default vault of this account that is available to be moved
      let availableBalance: UFix64
      // Amount of storage used by the account, in bytes
      let storageUsed: UInt64
      // storage capacity of the account, in bytes
      let storageCapacity: UInt64

      // Contracts deployed to the account

      let contracts: AuthAccount.Contracts

      // Keys assigned to the account

      let keys: AuthAccount.Keys

      // Account storage API (see the section below for documentation)

      fun save<T>(_ value: T, to: StoragePath)
      fun load<T>(from: StoragePath): T?
      fun copy<T: AnyStruct>(from: StoragePath): T?

      fun borrow<T: &Any>(from: StoragePath): T?

      fun link<T: &Any>(_ newCapabilityPath: CapabilityPath, target: Path): Capability<T>?
      fun getCapability<T>(_ path: CapabilityPath): Capability<T>
      fun getLinkTarget(_ path: CapabilityPath): Path?
      fun unlink(_ path: CapabilityPath)

      struct Contracts {

          // The names of each contract deployed to the account
          let names: [String]

          fun add(
              name: String,
              code: [UInt8],
              ... contractInitializerArguments
          ): DeployedContract

          fun update__experimental(name: String, code: [UInt8]): DeployedContract

          fun get(name: String): DeployedContract?

          fun remove(name: String): DeployedContract?
      }

      struct Keys {
          // Adds a new key with the given hashing algorithm and a weight, and returns the added key.
          fun add(
              publicKey: PublicKey,
              hashAlgorithm: HashAlgorithm,
              weight: UFix64
          ): AccountKey

          // Returns the key at the given index, if it exists, or nil otherwise.
          // Revoked keys are always returned, but they have `isRevoked` field set to true.
          fun get(keyIndex: Int): AccountKey?

          // Marks the key at the given index revoked, but does not delete it.
          // Returns the revoked key if it exists, or nil otherwise.
          fun revoke(keyIndex: Int): AccountKey?
      }
  }

  struct DeployedContract {
      let name: String
      let code: [UInt8]
  }
  ```

  A script can get the `AuthAccount` for an account address using the built-in `getAuthAccount` function:

  ```cadence
  fun getAuthAccount(_ address: Address): AuthAccount
  ```

  This `AuthAccount` object can perform all operations associated with authorized accounts, 
  and as such this function is only available in scripts, 
  which discard their changes upon completion. 
  Attempting to use this function outside of a script will cause a type error. 

## Account Creation

Accounts can be created by calling the `AuthAccount` constructor
and passing the account that should pay for the account creation for the `payer` parameter.

The `payer` must have enough funds to be able to create an account.
If the account does not have the required funds, the program aborts.

```cadence
transaction() {
    prepare(signer: AuthAccount) {
        let account = AuthAccount(payer: signer)
    }
}
```

## Account Keys

An account (both `PublicAccount` and `AuthAccount`) has keys associated with it.
An account key has the following structure.

```cadence
struct AccountKey {
    let keyIndex: Int
    let publicKey: PublicKey
    let hashAlgorithm: HashAlgorithm
    let weight: UFix64
    let isRevoked: Bool
}
```
Refer the [PublicKey](crypto/#publickey) section for more details on the creation and validity of public keys.

### Account Key API
Account key API provides a set of functions to manage account keys.

#### Add Account Keys
To authorize access to the account, keys can be added using the `add()` function.
Keys can only be added to an `AuthAccount`.

For example, to create an account and have the signer of the transaction pay for the account
creation, and authorize one key to access the account:

```cadence
transaction(publicKey: [UInt8]) {
    prepare(signer: AuthAccount) {
        let key = PublicKey(
            publicKey: publicKey,
            signatureAlgorithm: SignatureAlgorithm.ECDSA_P256
        )

        let account = AuthAccount(payer: signer)

        account.keys.add(
            publicKey: key,
            hashAlgorithm: HashAlgorithm.SHA3_256,
            weight: 10.0
        )
    }
}
```

To add a public key to an existing account, which signed the transaction:
```cadence
transaction(publicKey: [UInt8]) {
    prepare(signer: AuthAccount) {
        let key = PublicKey(
            publicKey: publicKey,
            signatureAlgorithm: SignatureAlgorithm.ECDSA_P256
        )

        signer.keys.add(
            publicKey: key,
            hashAlgorithm: HashAlgorithm.SHA3_256,
            weight: 10.0
        )
    }
}
```

#### Get Account Keys

Keys that are added to an account can be retrieved using `get()` function, using the index of the key.
Revoked keys are always returned, but they have `isRevoked` field set to true.
Returns `nil` if there is no key available at the given index.
Keys can be retrieved from both `PublicAccout` and `AuthAccount`.

```cadence
transaction() {
    prepare(signer: AuthAccount) {
        // Get a key from an auth account.
        let keyA = signer.keys.get(2)

        // Get a key from the public aacount.
        let publicAccount = getAccount(0x42)
        let keyB = publicAccount.keys.get(2)
    }
}
```

#### Revoke Account Keys

Keys that have been added to an account can be revoked using `revoke()` function.
Revoke function only marks the key at the given index as revoked, but never deletes it.
Keys can only be revoked from an `AuthAccount`.

```cadence
transaction() {
    prepare(signer: AuthAccount) {
        // Get a key from an auth account.
        let keyA = signer.keys.revoke(2)
    }
}
```

## Account Storage

All accounts have storage.
Both resources and structures can be stored in account storage.

### Paths

Objects are stored under paths.
Paths consist of a domain and an identifier.

Paths start with the character `/`, followed by the domain, the path separator `/`,
and finally the identifier.
For example, the path `/storage/test` has the domain `storage` and the identifier `test`.

There are only three valid domains: `storage`, `private`, and `public`.

Objects in storage are always stored in the `storage` domain.

Paths in the storage domain have type `StoragePath`,
in the private domain `PrivatePath`,
and in the public domain `PublicPath`.

`PrivatePath` and `PublicPath` are subtypes of `CapabilityPath`.

Both `StoragePath` and `CapabilityPath` are subtypes of `Path`.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="3">Path</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">CapabilityPath</td>
    <td colspan="2" rowspan="2">StoragePath</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>PrivatePath</td>
    <td>PublicPath</td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Path Functions

- `cadence•fun toString(): String`

  Returns the string representation of the path.

  ```cadence
  let storagePath = /storage/path

  storagePath.toString()  // is "/storage/path"
  ```

There are also utilities to produce paths from strings:

```cadence
fun PublicPath(identifier: string): PublicPath?
fun PrivatePath(identifier: string): PrivatePath?
fun StoragePath(identifier: string): StoragePath?
```

Each of these functions take an identifier and produce a path of the appropriate domain:

```cadence
let pathID = "foo"
let path = PublicPath(identifier: pathID) // is /public/foo
```

### Account Storage API

Account storage is accessed through the following functions of `AuthAccount`.
This means that any code that has access to the authorized account has access
to all its stored objects.

- `cadence•fun save<T>(_ value: T, to: StoragePath)`

  Saves an object to account storage.
  Resources are moved into storage, and structures are copied.

  `T` is the type parameter for the object type.
  It can be inferred from the argument's type.

  If there is already an object stored under the given path, the program aborts.

  The path must be a storage path, i.e., only the domain `storage` is allowed.

- `cadence•fun type(at path: StoragePath): Type?`

  Reads the type of an object from the account's storage which is stored under the given path, or nil if no object is stored under the given path.

  If there is an object stored, the type of the object is returned without modifying the stored object. 

  The path must be a storage path, i.e., only the domain `storage` is allowed

- `cadence•fun load<T>(from: StoragePath): T?`

  Loads an object from account storage.
  If no object is stored under the given path, the function returns `nil`.
  If there is an object stored, the stored resource or structure is moved
  out of storage and returned as an optional.
  When the function returns, the storage no longer contains an object
  under the given path.

  `T` is the type parameter for the object type.
  A type argument for the parameter must be provided explicitly.

  The type `T` must be a supertype of the type of the loaded object.
  If it is not, execution will abort with an error. 
  The given type does not necessarily need to be exactly the same as the type of the loaded object.

  The path must be a storage path, i.e., only the domain `storage` is allowed.

- `cadence•fun copy<T: AnyStruct>(from: StoragePath): T?`

  Returns a copy of a structure stored in account storage, without removing it from storage.

  If no structure is stored under the given path, the function returns `nil`.
  If there is a structure stored, it is copied.
  The structure stays stored in storage after the function returns.

  `T` is the type parameter for the structure type.
  A type argument for the parameter must be provided explicitly.

  The type `T` must be a supertype of the type of the copied structure.
  If it is not, execution will abort with an error. 
  The given type does not necessarily need to be exactly the same as
  the type of the copied structure.

  The path must be a storage path, i.e., only the domain `storage` is allowed.

```cadence
// Declare a resource named `Counter`.
//
resource Counter {
    pub var count: Int

    pub init(count: Int) {
        self.count = count
    }
}

// In this example an authorized account is available through the constant `authAccount`.

// Create a new instance of the resource type `Counter`
// and save it in the storage of the account.
//
// The path `/storage/counter` is used to refer to the stored value.
// Its identifier `counter` was chosen freely and could be something else.
//
authAccount.save(<-create Counter(count: 42), to: /storage/counter)

// Run-time error: Storage already contains an object under path `/storage/counter`
//
authAccount.save(<-create Counter(count: 123), to: /storage/counter)

// Load the `Counter` resource from storage path `/storage/counter`.
//
// The new constant `counter` has the type `Counter?`, i.e., it is an optional,
// and its value is the counter resource, that was saved at the beginning
// of the example.
//
let counter <- authAccount.load<@Counter>(from: /storage/counter)

// The storage is now empty, there is no longer an object stored
// under the path `/storage/counter`.

// Load the `Counter` resource again from storage path `/storage/counter`.
//
// The new constant `counter2` has the type `Counter?` and is `nil`,
// as nothing is stored under the path `/storage/counter` anymore,
// because the previous load moved the counter out of storage.
//
let counter2 <- authAccount.load<@Counter>(from: /storage/counter)

// Create another new instance of the resource type `Counter`
// and save it in the storage of the account.
//
// The path `/storage/otherCounter` is used to refer to the stored value.
//
authAccount.save(<-create Counter(count: 123), to: /storage/otherCounter)

// Load the `Vault` resource from storage path `/storage/otherCounter`.
//
// The new constant `vault` has the type `Vault?` and its value is `nil`,
// as there is a resource with type `Counter` stored under the path,
// which is not a subtype of the requested type `Vault`.
//
let vault <- authAccount.load<@Vault>(from: /storage/otherCounter)

// The storage still stores a `Counter` resource under the path `/storage/otherCounter`.

// Save the string "Hello, World" in storage
// under the path `/storage/helloWorldMessage`.

authAccount.save("Hello, world!", to: /storage/helloWorldMessage)

// Copy the stored message from storage.
//
// After the copy, the storage still stores the string under the path.
// Unlike `load`, `copy` does not remove the object from storage.
//
let message = authAccount.copy<String>(from: /storage/helloWorldMessage)

// Create a new instance of the resource type `Vault`
// and save it in the storage of the account.
//
authAccount.save(<-createEmptyVault(), to: /storage/vault)

// Invalid: Cannot copy a resource, as this would allow arbitrary duplication.
//
let vault <- authAccount.copy<@Vault>(from: /storage/vault)
```

As it is convenient to work with objects in storage
without having to move them out of storage,
as it is necessary for resources,
it is also possible to create references to objects in storage:
This is possible using the `borrow` function of an `AuthAccount`:

- `cadence•fun borrow<T: &Any>(from: StoragePath): T?`

  Returns a reference to an object in storage without removing it from storage.
  If no object is stored under the given path, the function returns `nil`.
  If there is an object stored, a reference is returned as an optional.

  `T` is the type parameter for the object type.
  A type argument for the parameter must be provided explicitly.
  The type argument must be a reference to any type (`&Any`; `Any` is the supertype of all types).
  It must be possible to create the given reference type `T` for the stored /  borrowed object.
  If it is not, execution will abort with an error. 
  The given type does not necessarily need to be exactly the same as the type of the borrowed object.

  The path must be a storage path, i.e., only the domain `storage` is allowed.

```cadence
// Declare a resource interface named `HasCount`, that has a field `count`
//
resource interface HasCount {
    count: Int
}

// Declare a resource named `Counter` that conforms to `HasCount`
//
resource Counter: HasCount {
    pub var count: Int

    pub init(count: Int) {
        self.count = count
    }
}

// In this example an authorized account is available through the constant `authAccount`.

// Create a new instance of the resource type `Counter`
// and save it in the storage of the account.
//
// The path `/storage/counter` is used to refer to the stored value.
// Its identifier `counter` was chosen freely and could be something else.
//
authAccount.save(<-create Counter(count: 42), to: /storage/counter)

// Create a reference to the object stored under path `/storage/counter`,
// typed as `&Counter`.
//
// `counterRef` has type `&Counter?` and is a valid reference, i.e. non-`nil`,
// because the borrow succeeded:
//
// There is an object stored under path `/storage/counter`
// and it has type `Counter`, so it can be borrowed as `&Counter`
//
let counterRef = authAccount.borrow<&Counter>(from: /storage/counter)

counterRef?.count // is `42`

// Create a reference to the object stored under path `/storage/counter`,
// typed as `&{HasCount}`.
//
// `hasCountRef` is non-`nil`, as there is an object stored under path `/storage/counter`,
// and the stored value of type `Counter` conforms to the requested type `{HasCount}`:
// the type `Counter` implements the restricted type's restriction `HasCount`

let hasCountRef = authAccount.borrow<&{HasCount}>(from: /storage/counter)

// Create a reference to the object stored under path `/storage/counter`,
// typed as `&{SomethingElse}`.
//
// `otherRef` is `nil`, as there is an object stored under path `/storage/counter`,
// but the stored value of type `Counter` does not conform to the requested type `{Other}`:
// the type `Counter` does not implement the restricted type's restriction `Other`

let otherRef = authAccount.borrow<&{Other}>(from: /storage/counter)

// Create a reference to the object stored under path `/storage/nonExistent`,
// typed as `&{HasCount}`.
//
// `nonExistentRef` is `nil`, as there is nothing stored under path `/storage/nonExistent`
//
let nonExistentRef = authAccount.borrow<&{HasCount}>(from: /storage/nonExistent)
```

## Storage limit

An account's storage is limited by its storage capacity.

An account's storage used is the sum of the size of all the data that is stored in an account (in MB).
An account's storage capacity is a value that is calculated from the amount of FLOW
that is stored in the account's main FLOW token vault. 

At the end of every transaction, the storage used is compared to the storage capacity.
For all accounts involved in the transaction, if the account's storage used is greater than its storage capacity, the transaction will fail.

An account's storage used and storage capacity can be checked using the `storageUsed` and `storageCapacity` fields.
The fields represent current values of storage which means this would be true:

```cadence
let storageUsedBefore = authAccount.storageUsed
authAccount.save(<-create Counter(count: 123), to: /storage/counter)
let storageUsedAfter = authAccount.storageUsed

let storageUsedChanged = storageUsedBefore != storageUsedAfter // is true
```
